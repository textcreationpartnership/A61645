         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In the true knowledge of the true God.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing obſervable in this Text is this; That the chiefeſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of every man conſiſteth in the true knowledge of the true God: For out of it I reaſon thus; That is mans chiefeſt wiſdome, in which hee ought more to rejoyce, then in all worldly wiſdome, or worldly ſtrength, or all earthly riches; in which moſt men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102519:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>have their chiefeſt rejoycing. But, every man is bound to glory more in the knowledge of God, then in worldly wiſdome, &amp;c. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is confirmed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. <hi>I will make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> and this is the ſumme of the covenant, <hi>They ſhall all know mee, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt:</hi> In which place is ſhewed what is the chiefeſt end of mans new creation, <hi>viz.</hi> the true knowledge of God: and therefore the people, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.3. after that the Lord had raiſed them from death to life, ſay, <hi>And we ſhall know the Lord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe without the knowledge of God, a man cannot know himſelfe. The knowledge of a man in things naturall is an excellent knowledge; yet it is nothing without the knowledge of himſelfe, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith. Though a man know all myſteries, to the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the ſea, and know not himſelfe, hee is like to a man that makes a building without a foundation: but without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, no man can know himſelfe; becauſe of that wicked pride that is naturally in man, that when hee lookes upon himſelfe, hee thinkes himſelfe ſo holy, juſt, pure, &amp;c. that hee thinks injuſtice to bee juſtice, impurity to be purity, &amp;c. but if once he comes to ſee the face of God, then hee ſees his owne juſtice to be injuſtice, and his owne purity to be impurity, and his owne righteouſneſſe to be folly; therefore it is the principall thing for a man to know God.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe without this, a man cannot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God aright, which is the end of his creation: and to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102519:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>this purpoſe there are many places of Scripture call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. <hi>Come, let us worſhip the Lord, for hee hath made us.</hi> The worſhip of God is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the firſt Table, and the principall thing in the firſt Table is the knowledge of God; intimating thus much, That there is no worſhip of God, where there is no knowledge of God: and therefore, that man might know how to worſhip him, he firſt declareth himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage:</hi> and this is the method which <hi>David</hi> layes downe to <hi>Solomon;</hi> firſt, <hi>Know thou the God of thy Father,</hi> and then, <hi>ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe without this, a man cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of true happineſſe. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternall to know thee the onely true God,</hi> that is to ſay, There is no way to attaine to life, but in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God. It is not the knowledge of all the things in the world that can make a man happy; but the knowledge of God can: for, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, Hee is an unhappy man that knowes all things, and is ignorant of the knowledge of God; but, ſaith he, hee that knowes thee, and is not vaine in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but labours to worſhip thee, hee is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man; but every man elſe is worſe then a Toade or Snake. And he (ſaith the ſame Father) that hath a tree, and can tell the height and breadth of it by a <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſtaffe, and knowes not the Creator of it, is an unhappy man; but another man that hath a tree, and cannot tell the height of it, nor knowes the number of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102519:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>of it, yet knowes thee the Creator of it, hee is the happy man; if hee bee never ſo poore, nay, if hee be as poore as <hi>Job,</hi> hee is the true happy man: but if he know all things, and know not thee, there is no way, but he muſt needs periſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This then ſhewes, That the chiefeſt folly of men is their ignorance of God; whether it be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ignorance in them to whom God hath denyed the meanes of knowledge; or a negligent ignorance in them who have the meanes, and doe not apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them; or a wilfull ignorance in them who pull themſelves from the meanes, whether they bee I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deots, that know nothing, or men of underſtanding and learning, that know other things, yet are fooles in the knowledge of God. <hi>Where is the Scribe? where is the learned Egyptian? where is the diſputer of the Law? but God hath choſen the poore and the baſe things of this world, that they ſhould confound the mighty,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. So, I may ſay, Where is the learned Egyptian? hath not God made the wiſe men of the world fools? We have a Proverb, <hi>The greateſt Clerks are not alwayes the wiſeſt men;</hi> True, if ignorant of God, and ſee not that true wiſdome ſtands in this. I may ſay, as the Wiſe-man ſaith, <hi>Why is there a price in the hand of a foole to get wiſdome, and hee hath no heart</hi> to it? <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.16. Why is there ſuch underſtanding in other things, and men have no heart to ſeeke after this? Certainely, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt calls them fools; for <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.13. faith, hee preferrs <hi>a young and wiſe child, before an old and fooliſh King that will not be inſtructed.</hi> So I ſay, a poore man, if wiſe in the knowledge of God, is better
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102519:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>then the wiſeſt Clerk in the world, being ignorant of God: Brethren, come out of this ignorance, labour for the knowledge of God, and labour for this in the firſt place, to know that yee are but fools, in all that yee know beſides God: and certainely, this will be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the beſt wiſdome; for then yee will ſay with the heathen man, Though I know all things, yet I know the leaſt part of that which I ought to know. And let mee tell you, this is the bane of knowledge, becauſe you think you know enough: The more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a man hath, the more ignorant hee ſeemes to himſelfe; and, <hi>he that thinks he knowes any thing, knows nothing yet as he ought to know,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. This ſhews their error, or rather impiety, that think the knowledge of God not neceſſary for women; of this fault are the Papiſts guilty; If this bee an error, I pitie them; but if impiety, I abhor it: for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that error is worthy the pitying; but iniquity is worthy to bee abhorred. Are not women bound to know themſelves, which they cannot doe without the knowledge of God? ſtand they not bound by creation to worſhip God aright, which they cannot doe without the knowledge of God? muſt they not be made partakers of the ſame glory, and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe with men? deny theſe if thou dareſt. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they are bound to know, God the Lord that made them, made man male and female in his owne image. If the woman muſt renew that ſhe loſt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> then ſhee ought to know God; ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Bee renewed in knowledge, after the image of him, Col.</hi> 3.10. Undoubtedly, this is nothing but the ſpite of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102519:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>hell, to hinder women from the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Brethren, beleeve you this that I ſay, that it is the chiefeſt wiſdome of man to know God? if ſo bee you beleeve, faith will breed care to accompliſh what you beleeve; you make knowne to us that you doe not beleeve, if you doe not take this care: And you muſt give me leave to beleeve, that if you doe not beleeve, then certainely you are Atheiſts. Brethren, doe you beleeve this to ſalvation? then you muſt doe as men doe in Trades, look what knowledge is moſt gainefull for them, and for that they labour above all others; this knowledge of God is the chiefeſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that belongs to the trade of a Chriſtian, labour for this. As Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shew mee</hi> your <hi>faith by</hi> your <hi>works</hi> if you bee willing to bee ſaved, or elſe you thruſt your ſelves into the mouth of the Divell. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that a Chriſtian without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, differs nothing from an Indian or a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; they are beyond thee, in the knowledge of Arts and Trades, they doe exceed thee: Now this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is that which makes thee a Chriſtian; without this thou art no better then an Indian or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: Wherefore, if thou wilt differ from Atheiſts, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the knowledge of God, elſe there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: therefore ſubmit your ſelves and your families to this order of catechizing; that you may pull your ſelves and your families out of the clawes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. And further, for help, you muſt uſe prayer and meditation, that you may come to it prepared. Art thou a Chriſtian, and canſt thou let the morning paſſe without private prayer with thy family, and with thy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102519:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſelfe alone? One demanded what would make a good Scholler; another anſwered, A good Maſter, and a good ſtudent, and thirdly, to teach others; and if you follow this courſe, happy ſhall you be.</p>

               <p>THis Pſalme ſheweth us what is the chiefeſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a man; and wee have found it out, that it is the true knowledge of the true God; Therefore, foraſmuch as God is inviſible, and no man hath ſeene God at any time (a principle ſo certaine, that for this cauſe the Jewes put the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid, that hee ſaw God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1. <hi>ſitting upon a throne, high and lifted up,</hi> &amp;c.) a neceſſary queſtion will ariſe, that ſince God cannot be ſeene,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> God is to bee knowne two wayes; Firſt, by Nature, and thoſe naturall notions that are in the mindes of men; or, by thoſe effects that declare this excellent workmanſhip, as his wiſdome, his power, his juſtice, his mercy, and the like. Secondly, by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; both of theſe intimated in that text that I have read, where hee ſaith, that God gave unto his Church his Law and Statutes. That wee may further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102519:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>this, It is manifeſt, that all Nations at all times have (as it were) groped after God, to finde what a kinde of one he was, that they might know him: This doth appeare by thoſe excellent Writings that many heathen men have written; as the books of <hi>Tully,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo by many teſtimonies of Scripture; as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had to doe with the Gentiles, preſt this thing, that by naturall reaſon God was to bee knowne, and that two wayes; either by the naturall and inbred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are planted in the mindes of men; or by thoſe great workes which were wrought by God. This appeares, becauſe that <hi>which might bee knowne of God, is manifeſt by his works, Rom.</hi> 1.20. the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of the Gentiles, and of the wiſe men of the Gentiles, that God might bee knowne in knowing of themſelves and of his works. The learned underſtand that place onely of Philoſophers, who by ſearch have knowne God; and they ſhould have taught this knowledge unto others, that God might have beene knowne by others alſo: but they, out of the pride of their hearts, kept it to themſelves: And to this purpoſe there is an Epiſtle extant of <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> which hee wrote to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, wherein hee ſaith that he had written them (meaning his Phyſicks) as if hee had not written: and the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27. that God was neere to every one of them by theſe effects, by his wiſdome, by his power, and the reſt, as the Creator and the things created; becauſe a man cannot looke upon any thing that God hath made, but hee ſhall ſee ſome footſteps leading to the knowledge of God; much more when hee ſhall looke upon the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102519:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>frame of heaven and earth; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy-works.</hi> The holy Ghoſt ſheweth that there is ſomething by which the moſt barbarous Nations that are cannot bee ignorant of God: therefore wee add that which the Apoſtle hath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things of God, even his eternall power and Godhead, are cleerely ſeene, being conſidered in his works,</hi> as his government, and preſervation of all things; therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, The Lord <hi>left not himſelf with out witneſſe, in that hee did good, and gave us raine, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 14.17. that though they had not his Word, yet they might grope after God. the Apoſtle alledgeth a proofe out of one of their owne Poets, that taught them, you are Gods generation; if you bee of Gods generation, you muſt have reaſon and underſtanding that you may in your ſelves finde out the knowledge of God. This ſpecially appeares in mans body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the body of man is called a little world, upon any part whereof if a man looke, hee may finde God; ſo that a man by naturall knowledge may come to know that there is a God, and what he is. And this is the Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Why is God to be knowne naturally?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Anſwer ſtands in three things: Firſt, becauſe there never was any Nation, Citie, or Family without religion, and a kinde of worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe that men by this naturall knowledge might be provoked to ſearch for a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe all men might be without excuſe.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102519:19"/>
               <p>Firſt, the anſwer ſtands thus; There have beene many Nations that knew not God by Revelation; but there never was any Nation, Citie, or Family without ſome kinde of worſhip. From whence we inferr, that they have ſome naturall knowledge of God; for, where there is religion, there is ſome knowledge that there is a God. This principle of the being of God was ſo deeply planted in them, that rather then they would not have a God, they worſhipped the works of their owne hands: and this ſhewes they have ſome naturall knowledge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath ſtill kept his Church in ſome eminent place, whither they (moved by this naturall inſtinct) might flie, to bee more fully inſtructed in the knowledge of the true God, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Come and let us goe up to the houſe of God, for hee will teach us his wayes.</hi> Indeed, we know ſomething of him by nature; but we know nothing as wee ought to know; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further by the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe all men might be without excuſe; ſo the Apoſtle affirmes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. that the inviſible things of God, as his eternall power and Godhead, were ſeene in his works, <hi>that they might bee without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe;</hi> they had ſuch a knowledge as told them that God was their Creator; <hi>that when they knew God,</hi> and <hi>glorified him not as God,</hi> &amp;c. they might have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: and for this cauſe it was that they had ſuch naturall knowledge. And this is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Is there then ſuch light naturally in the heart of man? this drawes us to this good meditation: Oh what an excellent knowledge was that in which wee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102519:19"/>were firſt created! Wee may gather this from the light that is left in us, even as the bigneſſe of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> his bodie was gathered by his foot, and as a man may ſee the bigneſſe of a Lion by his claw, or by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the ruines of a great houſe, may ſee what a Palace it ſometimes was; ſo when we looke upon the ruines of nature, wee may ſee in what an excellent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate we were at the firſt. For concluſion then, Let us take notice of our loſſe, that it may bee a provocation to make us recover our ſelves; ſeeing that wee had ſuch a knowledge, that we knew God perfectly, wee may endeavour to know him ſo againe; or, as men that have had great eſtates, and are fallen to decay, are carefull to recover themſelves, and neglect no meanes whereby they may recover their loſſe: ſo wee, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon our ſelves, may ſee our loſſe, and labour to recover it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Then ought wee continually to ſee God in the heavens, and in the earth, that by theſe viſible things wee may come to ſee the inviſible God, as the eternall power and Godhead; theſe things ſhould not be paſſed over ſlightly. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to draw us to a conſideration of this, calls it the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: ſo Chriſt teacheth us to conſider the Lilies of the field, and the Ravens, to ſee God in theſe; this <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. which whole Pſalm doth notably ſet forth God to be known by his works; ſo that in the leaſt creature wee may ſee God; yea, even in the leaſt Fly, as well as in the greateſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; ſo that by the meditation of the creature, we may ſee the beauty of the Creator. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102519:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>meditating, or looking upon the creature, Lord, ſaith hee, thou art beautifull, therefore haſt thou made them beautifull; thou art good, therefore they are good; thou haſt a being, therefore thou gaveſt them a being.</p>
               <p>This we know, yet this our knowledge being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the knowledge we had, is nothing but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: therefore let us labour to meditate on this, that by ſearching wee may finde out God. Hee is a good Clerk that can read in theſe books, and ſhall bee drawn to ſee the wiſdome, power, and juſtice of God: but as the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11, 12.) complaines, that no man conſiders the works of the Lord, they have the Pipe and Lute in their Feaſts: So wee may ſay, that many are ſo taken up with pleaſure and other vanities, that they will not conſider the works of God; and therefore no marvell that they are ſo ignorant, becauſe they will not goe out of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How is God knowne above nature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By Revelation; and that either by his Word or Spirit. The knowledge of God which is by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a common knowledge, it belongs to all men: but this that is above nature, is the particular voice that ſounds in the Church.</p>
               <p>The firſt way whereby God is knowne to us above nature is the Word; whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19 7. ſaith, <hi>The Teſtimonies of the Lord are ſure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the eyes,</hi> revealing the object, enabling the organ. He hath given his Lawes and his Statutes unto Iſrael, <hi>hee hath not dealt ſo with every Nation:</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102519:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>but the onely begotten Sonne of God, and hee to whom hee will reveale him, John</hi> 1.17. So Saint <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 17.23. ſpeaks to the Athenians, <hi>him doe I declare unto you whom you ignorantly worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond way that hee reveales himſelfe, is by his Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to babes.</hi> Alſo 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>You have an oyntment,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and you need not that any one teach you, but the Spirit of God teacheth you all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why hath God made himſelfe manifeſt after this manner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For three reaſons: Firſt, becauſe that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we have by nature is obſcure. Secondly, becauſe that knowledge without this is imperfect and partiall. Thirdly, becauſe the knowledge of the Word is not effectuall without the Spirit.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; God hath revealed himſelfe by his Word, becauſe the diſcovery which nature makes is marvellous obſcure. <hi>Simonides,</hi> a great Philoſopher, being asked by <hi>Hieron</hi> the Tyrant, what God was, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired two daies reſpite; and then being asked, he deſired two dayes more; and then being asked, hee deſired two dayes more: then the Tyrant asked him why he did ſo; becauſe ſaith hee, the more I ſeek after him, the farther off I am from finding him; ſo that nature is obſcure. And ſecondly, it is imperfect, becauſe that knowledge of nature without the Word, knowes but a peece of God; and therefore, becauſe God would have his Church know him perfectly, he adds
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102519:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>his Word to his works; and in this reveales himſelfe more fully, and diſcovers thoſe wonders which nature could not onely not diſcover, but not comprehend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed, as the great myſtery of the Trinity, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The knowledge of Nature is not a ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for though it knowes God as Creator, yet it knowes him not as Redeemer. <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them you finde eternall life, and they are they that teſtifie of mee;</hi> and therefore God adds his Word, that he may be known as a Redeemer and Reconciler, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The knowledge of the Word is not effectuall without the Spirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. It is <hi>neither Paul, nor Apollos, &amp;c. but God that gives the increaſe.</hi> The knowledge of the Word is outward, but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Spirit is inward, and man cannot teach inwardly; and therefore there cannot be ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without the Spirit, for man can but ſpeake to the eare; yea, though he may preſſe it vehemently, yet without the Spirit it is nothing; God therefore hath joyned the Word and Spirit together: and ſo the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is cleered in theſe three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Seeing that by the principles of Nature a man cannot come to ſaving knowledge, hee muſt therefore labour for the knowledge of the Word of God; hee muſt not be a ſtranger to the Word, nor the Word a ſtranger to him, that hee may know God. If a man cannot be partaker of true happineſſe but by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; and if all ſaving knowledge be by the Word, then it neceſſarily followes, that hee muſt bee acquainted with the Word: If hee bee a ſtranger to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102519:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Word, and the Word a ſtranger to him, ſurely he is a ſtranger to the life of God. I will not ſtand to ſhew how the Divell bewitcheth many wiſe men, that are carefull to provide for their children, and bring them up in naturall knowledge, but ſcorne this which we muſt moſt labour for, to have the Word familiar; we muſt hearken to the counſell of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. to <hi>let the Word of God dwell plentifully in us in all wiſdome. Chryſoſtome</hi> preſſing this place, <hi>Let the Word dwell in you richly, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith thus, It is not, Let the Word come into you as a ſtranger for a night; but let it dwell in you as a familiar friend. Why ſir, wee may know a ſentence or two; No, but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let the Word dwell plentifully in you:</hi> If a man have learned ſome ſentences by heart, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have learned whole books, this is not that which the Apoſtle meanes, but <hi>let it dwell in you in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> where the Apoſtle will have us diligent to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Word: Why ſo? becauſe there God hath revealed himſelfe. <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.5. <hi>If thou apply thy heart to inſtruction;</hi> it is not, if thou wilt read a Chapter or two, but thou muſt beate thy head about it, and apply thy heart unto it; for what ſaith the Wiſe man in the 5. verſe? <hi>If thou ſearch for her as for ſilver and gold, then thou ſhalt underſtand the way of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God.</hi> It is not to bee gotten by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe; but, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> as men doe when they have loſt any thing, as the woman that loſt the groat; it argues a diligent ſearching: this is that the Authour to the Hebrews ſpeaks of, about which wee ought to have our wits exerciſed through
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102519:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>long cuſtome. Bretheren, It is inexcuſable (if not damnable) idleneſſe in many men, that they have no heart to read the Scriptures: Whatſoever you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that you cannot for your callings; I tell you, that neither your callings, nor the works of your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings will excuſe you in that day when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed; you doe abuſe God, you ought to afford your ſelves time, and you muſt afford your ſelves ſo much time: you have time enough to ſpend in courting, and in wantonneſſe, and in other idle vanities. Will you have Chriſt to know you, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge you, when your callings, and all other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are gone, and ceaſe? what a queſtion is this? who would not have that willingly? then muſt you take care to know Chriſt here, or elſe he will not know you hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Seeing that this is ſo, then every man ſhould labour for the Spirit of God, that hee may be able to profit by the Word preached or read. Without him a man may have a knowledge, but not a ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: It is an excellent benefit for a man to have good teachers; but it is no benefit in compariſon of this, that the Spirit becomes our teacher; for, <hi>who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth like him? Job</hi> 36.22. therefore labour for this teacher. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the teachers are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; but hee ſits in heaven that muſt teach the heart, therefore looke to him: wee can but make a noiſe in your eares by any our moſt earneſt expreſſions and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement cries, but it muſt bee the Spirit that makes all effectuall. I pray you tell me, ſaith the ſame Father, what doth the Husbandman? can hee doe any thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102519:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>but the outward work? doth he doe any thing inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? can he make an apple? can he make a leafe? hee cannot; it is God that doth that. Aske the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and hee will tell you, <hi>It is Paul that plants, and Apollos that waters, but it is God that gives the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;</hi> therefore labour that you may have that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting: you may not bee negligent of the Word, which is the means that God will have uſed, who will not give effectuall knowledge without it; therefore Miniſters muſt plant, but if you will have fruit by the miniſtery, you muſt labour to have the Spirit. That which makes the Word unprofitable is, that men look ſo much upon the husbandman, therefore God doth oftentimes ſend a bad harveſt. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the goodneſſe of the ground, and ſomewhat in the husbandman if the harveſt bee good; but ſaving knowledge is no where to bee looked for, but from God: therefore every man muſt labour earneſtly to have the inward teacher. It is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.1. that <hi>Rachel</hi> was barren while ſhe looks upon the husband; but when ſhe goes to prayer, in <hi>verſe</hi> 22. then ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives: ſo, many of you looke too much upon your Miniſters, and therefore there is little profit; but lift up your ſelves in prayer to God, and hee will make you profit, ſo that ye ſhall have the ſaving knowledge of God in this life, and after this life ſalvation it ſelfe, even life eternall, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>WEE have heard of a twofold knowledge of God, the one by Nature, the other by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is by the Word and Spirit; by which you have heard how a man may come to ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Now to proceed; The next queſtion is,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>In what Word is this knowledge to be ſought?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is to bee ſought in the written Word of God, the old and new Teſtament. Seeing God hath revealed himſelfe in his Word, and that there is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge to be found in it, though not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall without the Spirit; (I think) this ſeems reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that before we ſpeak of God himſelf, wee ſpeak ſomthing of the holy Scriptures, the fountain of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in which God hath revealed himſelfe to the world, that we may know with what warrant we may ground our faith upon them: Therefore it is neceſſary that wee know firſt what this Word is, and then what Author it hath?</p>
               <p>Anſwer is made, that this ſaving knowledge is to bee ſought and found in the written Word of God. This is warranted upon that which I have read, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are they which teſtifie of me:</hi> this is further confirmed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law &amp; to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:</hi> if queſtion ariſe concerning God, where ſhall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102519:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>wee finde anſwer? <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimonies;</hi> goe to the written Word of God: of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. that it <hi>is able to make a man wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> and therefore it carries in it the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge of God, by which a man muſt be ſaved. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. calls it <hi>a more ſure Word</hi> (making oppoſition betweene it and the word they heard from heaven in the holy mount) <hi>to which wee ought to take heed, as to a light ſhining,</hi> &amp;c. Finally, our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks of this in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the rich man, <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets;</hi> if they will know any thing concerning God, faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp;c. what need one be raiſed from the dead? So then, theſe teſtimonies ſhew, that the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is to be had in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Queſtion brings another, and that is this,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is knowledge to bee ſought in the old and new Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, becauſe this is the perfect rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining all things to be known and beleeved. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is a certaine and a ſure rule. Thirdly, it is an infallible rule, that neither deceives, nor can bee deceived. To explaine this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is a perfect rule, therefore this knowledge is to be ſought there: <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt add nothing to it, nor take any thing from it:</hi> Add to it, and thou makeſt it imperfect; take from it, and thou makeſt it no leſſe imperfect, becauſe it is of it ſelfe an abſolute and full rule. The Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The word is given by inſpiration, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, rebuke,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is able to make the man of God
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102519:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>perfect,</hi> &amp;c. It is full for all purpoſes, for inſtruction, correction, &amp;c. and for all perſons; it perfects the Miniſter in his work and calling; and if him, then much more every other man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a certain knowne rule: That which is the rule of ſalvation, muſt be a certaine knowne rule (if it be unknowne, it is no rule) to thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved. The Word ſometime, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> was wholly unwritten; yet then no doubt but God revealed himſelfe to the faithfull. But when the Church was growne up to bee a Nation, and mixed with unfaithfull and faithfull; God, that hee might make a certaine rule, by <hi>Moſes</hi> writ his Word: And that the Word was written for this end, it appeares, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto thee, moſt noble Theophilus, that thou mighteſt bee certaine of theſe things:</hi> there goes a report of Chriſt what he did, and what hee ſuffered, <hi>theſe things have I written, that thou mighteſt be certaine:</hi> and therefore our Saviour Chriſt being asked the queſtion in the Goſpel, what was to be done <hi>to inherit eternall life,</hi> hee anſwers, <hi>How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou? Luk.</hi> 10.26. Wilt thou be certaine? then read the Scriptures, and they will manifeſtly and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare what is to be done, and give a perfect anſwer to ſuch queſtions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to come now to the written Word, becauſe the written Word is an infallible rule; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule is ſuch a rule as cannot bee deceived nor deceive; for if it could doe either, it were not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but that the Word of God is ſuch, that it cannot deceive nor bee deceived, I manifeſt it thus, becauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102519:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>God and his Word are one Truth, therefore it cannot deceive; <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them with thy Truth, thy Word is Truth.</hi> As light is not the cauſe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo the Word is not the cauſe of error. This is a right rule, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> thy Writings are my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, by them I ſhall never be deceived. And this is the firſt point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If this bee ſo, here are overthrowne all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions which are by man added to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: all traditions that are either written or carried from hand to hand are rejected; whatſoever is taught without the Scripture, is to be abhorred; for the Word is the rule, and he that brings any other doctrine, let him be accurſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. This ſerves to provoke men to labour for the knowledge of the Word. Here I will take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeake of it, becauſe I ſee the careleſneſſe of this age. If there bee any amongſt us that deſire the knowledge of God, then wee ſhould labour for the knowledge of his Word: Why? becauſe wee cannot know God, unleſſe wee know his Word. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude againſt God, that hee ſhould vouchſafe his Word, and wee not labour to know it; this is impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt our ſelves, that look to bee ſaved, and yet neglect the knowledge of the Word that brings ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is a knowledge of God by nature; but the remainder of the light that is in mans nature is marvellous dark: Though the fooliſh heathen ſay, If a man follow nature hee cannot erre, wee know that nature is ſtarke blinde in matters appertaining to God; therefore men ſhould labour to know the Word, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102519:25"/>it might dwell in them in all wiſdome. Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, This is the portion of the Jewes, that they have the letter onely, and ſo the portion of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and not of Chriſtians. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, Oh unhappy hereticks, which regard nothing but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſound of the letter, having a body without a ſoule! Therefore men that will have a bodie and a ſoul together, muſt labour to have the underſtanding of the places that they read; and to this end, they muſt add meditation to their reading, and conſtant and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer to God to their meditation, that hee would give his ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation: and by this meanes they ſhall be able to ſearch out hidden and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things that are not diſcerned by others. Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, when he was entred upon a text upon <hi>Cant.</hi> This Well is deepe, and I have nothing to draw; but yet I ſee by experience, that if a man cover the Well with a linnen cloth, he ſhall wring out ſome moyſture which otherwiſe hee ſhould not: I have therefore bended my ſelfe upon it, and ſtretched my hands to thee, that thou wouldeſt reveale ſomething to mee, for every man bending and ſtretching himſelfe, his heart and his hands to God, ſhall receive ſomething; for, <hi>the enterance to thy Word,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, giveth light. Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>a diligent hand maketh rich;</hi> a little ſtock to begin with, being diligently imployed, maketh rich: So it is in ſpirituall things, <hi>a diligent hand maketh rich;</hi> if a man have a little knowledge, if hee have a diligent heart and hand, though the Word bee as it were in a dark place, yet hee ſhall ſee more and more.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102519:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>There are two things to be enquired of concerning the written Word of God; Firſt, <hi>by</hi> whom it was written: Secondly, <hi>for</hi> whom it was written. For the firſt; that is, <hi>by</hi> whom this Word was written, time will not give me leave to ſpeake of; therefore I will proceed to the next.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>For whom was this Word written?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For all men, of all ages and conditions; the text that I have read proves it: <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi> to whom did Chriſt ſpeak? To all men, of all Nations and Countries that were gathered there together. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is made to you, and to your children, and to as many as the Lord God ſhall call:</hi> the promiſes were not made to the Jewes onely, but alſo to the Gentiles, even <hi>to as many as the Lord ſhall call;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word is written for all: <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things were written afore time, were written for our learning;</hi> they were not written for them onely, but for us alſo, <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come: Theſe things are come upon them for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. Therefore it is apparent, that the Word was written for all men. Out of this ariſeth another queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How is it proved, that it is written for all men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Three wayes, beſides the teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Firſt, becauſe the Lord that writ it is Lord over all, perfect in wiſdome. Secondly, becauſe this written Word is Gods revealed will. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is but one way to ſalvation for all men, and this is laid downe in it.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:102519:26"/>
               <p>Wee will manifeſt this: Firſt, becauſe it is Gods Word; and God is over all times, over all places, and over all perſons, as well ſucceſſors as predeceſſors, as well them that goe before, as them that follow after; therefore the Word belongs to all. We have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>New Lords, new Lawes:</hi> but it is not ſo here; God doth keepe alwayes one Law; Kings that have their ſeverall Kingdomes, have all ſeverall Lawes; the reaſon is, becauſe they cannot make Lawes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſubjects, and amongſt them, one thinks this fit, another thinks that: but the Lord is an abſolute King, that makes Lawes without men; <hi>for the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is, Pſal.</hi> 24.1. I add to this, that hee is perfect in wiſdome: men, when they have made Lawes, they repeale them againe, becauſe they are imperfect in wiſdome, and cannot foreſee what will bee convenient for after times. But God is perfect in wiſdome; therefore his Lawes are alwaies the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it is Gods revealed will, the rule of juſtice, by which things are made good or evill; and therefore it muſt needs bee a univerſall Law; his will is over all, his Word and himſelfe have the ſame extent, without any reſtraint whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe there is but one way to ſalvation, and that is by the Word; the Word brings ſalvation to all men of all times, and of all conditions; never had any man any way but one, and that is, by fulfilling of the Law: only there is this difference between the Law of works, and the Goſpel; for that by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, all that will be ſaved by the Law, muſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102519:26"/>doe the works of the Law themſelves; by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, all that will bee ſaved by the Goſpel, muſt apply by faith the fulfilling of the Law by Chriſt; for he <hi>is the end of the Law to ſalvation,</hi> he muſt be applyed to every man that will bee ſaved: ſo that here is an admirable concluſion, that man muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by mercy and juſtice; and for this the Word was written for all men, and for all ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. If this be ſo, then it is neceſſary that all men ſhould have the Word of God in their own language, though it was written in another language, and before they were, yet it was written for them; a point that our Jeſuits cry down, that every woman, and every boy, and every maide ſhould have the Word; they cry out of it, but if God writ it as well for the unlearned as for the learned, why ſhould they not have it? when God firſt writ the Bible, did hee write it in a ſtrange language? If God had beene minded to have had the Word ſhut up from the people, hee would have writ it in a ſtrange language; but God in his wiſdome wrote it not in a ſtrange language, but in ſuch a one as all might read: Nay more then this, the Churches at all times have had their Bibles tranſlated into their owne languages. Certainely, the Spirit of God never knew that which the Preſident of the Councell of Trent ſaith, A Diſtaffe was more fit for a woman then a Bible; when as God hath commanded that women ſhould read it as well as men; a Diſtaffe is fit in due times and ſeaſons: but theſe doe accuſe God, as the Divell in the Serpent did, when he ſaid to <hi>Evah,</hi> God would not have you to know this; this is nothing but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102519:27"/>the brood of the Serpent. Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, Theeves when they meane to ſteale, firſt put out the candle; ſo hereticks, when they meane to deceive, firſt corrupt the Scriptures. The Papiſts themſelves have tranſlated the old and new Teſtament into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, but ſo darkly, that none that reads them (unleſſe hee be a Scholler) can underſtand them: their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating proves againſt themſelves the lawfulneſſe of a tranſlation; for how dare they doe that which they judge unlawfull? their affectation of obſcurity is a mocking of God and of his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Was the Word written for mee? then I ought to have a care to read it, and to underſtand it: This is the ground of all; wee ſhall never doe you good with teaching, except you read the Scriptures privately; God hath written them for you, as if your names were expreſſed in them. If a man had lived in the Church of Corinth when the Epiſtle was written to the Corinthians, would hee have thought that hee had beene excluded? nay, hee would rather have thought himſelfe to have beene bound to have read it. The whole Word of God is Gods Epiſtle to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If an Emperor ſhould write a letter to thee, ſaith <hi>Gregory,</hi> thou wouldſt not reſt till thou hadſt read it; but when God writes this letter of life and ſalvation, wilt thou not read it? how ungratefull art thou to God? Thou wilt confeſſe the whole Church worthy to bee condemned, if it ſhould neglect the reading of the Scriptures: then thou being a member of the Church, condemneſt thy ſelfe. A man <hi>may</hi> read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther books, but hee <hi>muſt</hi> read this; there is a neceſſity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102519:27"/>laid upon him, therefore hee muſt read them: And know, thou man and woman, thou art in a fearfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, when thou maieſt reade the Scriptures, and yet neglecteſt them. Brethren, know it for a truth, (for you ſhall one day know it) that though you have now excuſes why you cannot reade (as becauſe you cannot neglect your callings, &amp;c.) yet the time will come when you ſhall have no excuſe to keep you from being condemned: If ever therefore you look to have ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you muſt read the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. This muſt teach us, that a man muſt not read onely, but hee muſt apply alſo to himſelfe; hee muſt not read it for others, but hee muſt apply it to himſelfe, to his eſtate and condition. Wee have a common ſpeech, That that which is ſaid in generall, is ſpoken to none; but it is not true here: that which Chriſt ſaid to all, Watch, hee ſaid to every one; that which God ſaith to all, Read, hee ſaith to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon: as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Wee are to obſerve every ſeverall occaſion, to make uſe of every ſentence. Doth the Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing to bee done? or doth it forbid any thing? doth it threaten any evill, or promiſe any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? labour to know it, that it may comfort thee, that it may inſtruct thee, &amp;c. and this is to read the Word profitably, for every man to learne his owne leſſon thereby: many bad Schollers, when they cannot read their owne leſſon, can read anothers; ſo, many can learne others leſſons, but they cannot learne their own; as, they can ſay, This text meets with ſuch a one. See what a trewant thou art in this Schoole of Chriſt; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102519:28"/>to know thy leſſon; as, this threatning ſerves to terrifie mee, this promiſe to comfort mee, &amp;c. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, many men make a partiall application; ſome will apply the promiſes, but not the threatnings; take heed of eating too much honey, the promiſes will doe thee no good, if firſt thou have not applyed the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; hee that takes not his part in the threatnings hath no part in the promiſes: therefore take a view of the whole Booke of God. Againe, they that have a trembling conſcience can ſee nothing but threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; theſe are onely ſuch as the Lord leaves for a while, they cannot apply the promiſes to themſelves; but the other are in a worſe condition then theſe, for of theſe there is hope, becauſe the Lord is fitting them for himſelfe: but labour thou to apply the whole Word, that thou maieſt ſee thy ſelfe. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a looking-glaſſe, ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory;</hi> and a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſs, we know, is to ſee both what is comely, and what is deformed; ſo is the Word, to diſtinguiſh things that differ, and to diſcover good and evill: by the Law is the knowledge of ſin, and duty; therefore labour to make uſe of it. All the Word is written for thee as well as for any, every part of it as well as any part; therefore apply it to thy ſelfe, that thou maieſt have comfort and mercy in this life, and eternall happineſſe in the life to come.</p>

               <p>IT hath been ſhewed, that the ſaving knowledge of God is to be found in the Word, and that the Word is written: It is neceſſary to be conſidered who writ it, and for whom it was written; Of the former of theſe, By whom it was written, is now to be handled at this time.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>By whom was this Word written?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was given by God, by divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. the proofe of which is manifeſt out of this text that I have read, <hi>All Scriptures are by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration;</hi> and in this reſpect it was called Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe, that not onely the matter, but the voice, the ſtile, the phraſe was by inſpiration from God. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writings may be the Word of God; but this was by Gods appointment, <hi>the writing was the writing of God, Exod.</hi> 32.16. for <hi>Moſes,</hi> at firſt writ not the Commandements, but God; and after the Tables were broken, they were no leſſe the Word of God then before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.18. others were the pen-men, but God the hand; others the inſtruments, but God the maker and author of this Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.8. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. there is no Prophecie but it comes from God; holy men of God writ them, and they ſpake them,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102519:29"/>not by the will of man, but <hi>by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> This truth, becauſe it is of weight, and hath great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, and breeds great doubts in men, we will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to eſtabliſh, and for further confirmation of it, we will confirme it by internall and externall arguments; internall I call thoſe that are in the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in the minde of men; externall, thoſe that doe confirme theſe.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth this appeare, that it was written by divine inſpiration from God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> By internall arguments, that are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, from the doctrine it ſelfe, and excellencie thereof.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, from the majeſtie of the ſtile.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, from the perpetuall conſent of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. To examine theſe:</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The firſt argument is, the doctrine which is ſo holy and divine, that no man could write but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdome; and that is thus manifeſted: 1. From the greatneſſe of theſe things written, ſurpaſſing all humane reaſon. 2. From the purity of the Word, which convinceth men of injuſtice, and yet teacheth all men to bee juſt. 3. From the conſent; there is an admirable communion betweene juſtice and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; betweene the ſalvation of men by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and ſanctification by the holy Ghoſt: No man could think of any ſuch thing, till the Scripture did reveale it. 4. Laſtly, The end of the writing, which is onely the glory of God, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let him that rejoiceth rejoice in the Lord;</hi> this abaſeth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102519:29"/>and advanceth grace, therefore it cannot be but by divine inſpiration.</p>
               <p>Againe, no writing can bring comfort to a man but the Scriptures; <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.40. <hi>Theſe things have beene written, that wee through patience might have comfort of the Scriptures:</hi> theſe are ſuch things that a man could never attaine to but by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The ſecond proofe that wee gave, was the majeſtie of the ſtile. Whoſoever is exerciſed in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scripture, ſhall plainly ſee, that no meer man was ever able to write it of himſelfe. The excellencie of the ſtile is ſo great, that, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports, they thereby tryed the writing of hereticks; if the ſtile doth not agree to this of the Prophets and Apoſtles, they are to be rejected. If wee will know all true au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, wee muſt know it by the ſtile; for, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a falſe Writer may take to him the name and frame of another man, yet hee cannot take his ſtile; for, as every man hath his ſeverall countenance, and ſeverall colour, that though two bee never ſo like, yet there are ſome things whereby they may bee diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſo the writings of other men may bee knowne from the Scriptures, on which the holy Ghoſt hath ſet ſuch a ſtile as is not to bee found in all or any the writings of all the world beſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The third ground was the conſent of Chriſt and the Apoſtles with the Prophets that went before them; the latter Prophets conſent with the former, and the former agree with them; therefore this muſt needs be from a divine direction. For, amongſt men who have written of the ſame ſubject wee may finde
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102519:30"/>often variance, but theſe did never really contradict one another, there is no diſcrepance in them to bee found: there were ſome thouſands of yeers between the firſt Prophets writings and the Apoſtles, and ſome thouſands of miles betweene the Prophets and Apoſtles that wrote at the ſame time, yet all doe agree together: the ground is this, becauſe Truth (as God) is ever conſtant to it ſelfe. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> reproves <hi>Hanani, Jer.</hi> 28. becauſe hee did not conſent to the Prophets that went before him; and the Apoſtle pronounceth an anathema againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or an Angel, or whoſoever ſhould teach any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine. All which ſhewes, that there is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous conſent in the Scriptures, and therefore they muſt needs be written by God, and not by men.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What other internall Arguments are there in the mindes of men, to prove the Scripture the Word of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is proved, firſt by the Spirit of God, who witneſſeth the ſame in the hearts of the Elect: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the power and efficacie of the Word, and the working it hath in the hearts of men. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine this,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Spirit of God witneſſeth this in the hearts of the Elect; God is the beſt witneſſe of himſelfe, ſo is the Spirit the beſt witneſſe of the Word, which is not beleeved untill it be ſettled in the heart of man by the Spirit that wrote it; for till then wee reject it. Some apply that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My Spirit that I have put upon thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c. In this manner the Spirit and the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102519:30"/>Word muſt agree together, and continually bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe each to other; whatſoever is ſuggeſted by the Spirit, and agreeth not with the Word, is to bee reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; whatſoever is expreſſed in the Word, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved till witneſſed by the Spirit. I add to theſe Chriſts owne ſpeech to the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 8.42, 43. who bragged that God was their Father; if God bee your father, why doe you not beleeve my words? for if God be your Father, then you have the Spirit of God; but it is apparant, that you have the Spirit of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you beleeve not my words, and therefore God is not your Father. <hi>John</hi> 10.27. <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice;</hi> that is, they doe acknowledge that this is my voice: <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>I have other ſheep that are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring in, and they ſhall heare my voice:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. the ſhepheard <hi>calleth his ſheep by name, and they follow him, and a ſtranger will they not follow:</hi> where he ſheweth, that the ſons of God have the Spirit of God in them, whereby they are able to diſcerne the writings of God from other writings; the Spirit of God giving them a cleare underſtanding to ſee, and a perſwaſion to beleeve the truth of them, and ſuch a perſwaſion as no man knowes out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but in himſelfe. It is true (as wee ſaid before) That the majeſtie of the ſtile, and the conſent of the Writers, are great arguments to prove the Scriptures Gods Word; but yet they give a man no aſſurance, but onely breed in him a kinde of reverence, as <hi>Salvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaith: But if a man bee once enlightened with the Spirit of God, hee reſts not on his owne judgement, nor on the judgement of all the world, becauſe hee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102519:31"/>hath inward judgement in himſelfe, which is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And thus much for the firſt internall argument.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is taken from the mindes of men, and from the power and efficacie that the Word hath in the hearts and conſciences of all men: It hath a power to convert them to God, to terrifie and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, and alſo to comfort them in diſtreſſes, to wound them, and to make them whole, which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writing can doe; therefore it cannot be humane, but divine: This is manifeſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoule.</hi> No Philoſopher can convert the heart (though hee may bring men to outward civilitie) like unto this. The Word gives wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the ſimple, and therefore is divine: It was that which made S. <hi>Paul</hi> to know that hee was dead; for before the Law came hee was alive, but when the Law came he was dead. This the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preſſeth to the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.27, 28. by which hee wounded them, and with the ſame Word hee healed them; no other Word could ever bring them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of their owne righteouſneſſe, no other could ſuſtaine them deſpairing; <hi>this is the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Rom.</hi> 1.16. Finally, <hi>it is powerfull in operation, Heb.</hi> 4.11. it is mighty to make a man at variance with himſelfe, the father againſt his ſonne, the mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the daughter; nothing was ever able to doe this but the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What externall proofes are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, the fulfilling of the Prophecies in the Scripture, in the ſame manner and the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in the ſame time, and in the ſame perſons;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102519:31"/>things many hundred yeers before foretold, are ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed as foretold: this therefore cannot bee but a divine prediction. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.22. The Prophet ſpeaks of the Idols, <hi>Come, and let them tell us what ſhall come to paſſe hereafter;</hi> arguing, that to doe ſo muſt bee a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thing. The Divell cannot foretell things to come; hee may gheſſe at them, but hee hath alwaies his ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting holes; but the holy Scripture hath ſet downe in plaine termes the time, and the perſons, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtances, as 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore it muſt needs bee a divine wiſdome that did indite and inſpire them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond externall argument is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of theſe, they are ancienter then any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings whatſoever: the Egyptians indeed brag, That they had writings before <hi>Moſes;</hi> but it is nothing but bragging and untruth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The great oppoſition that hath beene made againſt them, and their preſervation. It is true, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> burnt the books of his Maſter <hi>Plato,</hi> a great Philoſopher, that himſelfe might bee the more obſerved; but hee could never burne them all; he was but one, and many oppoſed him: But when whole Kingdomes and Countries, even the whole world have violently, for a long time, and many ages ſet themſelves againſt theſe, and yet they are preſerved, the preſervation of them argues a ſpeciall divine care of them, as of divine writings. <hi>Mac.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Antiochus</hi> burnt this booke, and made a law, that whoſoever had this book ſhould die the death; yet it is preſerved, that not ſo much as a ſyllable of it is wanting. Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102519:32"/>and whatſoever elſe is of man, may bee deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by man, may faile of themſelves, as ſaith <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> but the things of God, and divine writings ſhall abide for ever: See this difference in the writings of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> thoſe of his owne wiſdome are loſt, thoſe inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God abide till this day, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The perſecutions that have been made at all times againſt the profeſſors of this Book, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in beleeving it, obeying it, and laying downe their lives for it, which none could have done, had not the writing been divine. (Indeed, a few deſperate men have laid downe their lives for their owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; but not any that hath ſo valiantly laid downe his life, as the profeſſors of the Goſpel:) All theſe are ſufficient proofes for this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This muſt firſt teach us, that the Word is cleare and plaine (becauſe the writing of God) for the inſtruction of men: certainly, God would never write obſcurely and in the darke: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>It is a light in a darke place.</hi> When we ſay it is plain and clear, it is ſo in it ſelf; though the naturall man diſcerneth it not, and to the regenerate man it may be hard. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, the Saints never pray to God, Make thy Law eaſie; but, Give us underſtanding, and open our eyes, that wee may ſee thy Law: the truth is, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties in it, but there is nothing difficult which in other places is not made plaine, if neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Scripture, as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, is both meat and drink, drink needs no chewing: ſome places are eaſie, that they need no chewing; and ſome places are hard, to ſtir up men to ſeek them out, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102519:32"/>There are many things in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles that are hard, but to whom? to the ignorant: they are eaſie in themſelves, and to the regenerate; therefore ſaith one, What need have we of Commentaries added to the Word, if Commentaries add not light to the Word, but the Word makes Commentaries light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. This teacheth us, that becauſe the Word was written to every man, therefore every man was bound to ſtudie it, and to read it; and ſeeing the Word was inſpired by the Spirit of God, therefore when a man goes about to read it and heare it, hee ought to pray for underſtanding, and for Gods Spirit by which hee writ it; for they that wrote it, did it not without Gods Spirit: men ſhould pray that God would give them his Spirit of wiſdome to open their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; ſurely, the greateſt light in the world cannot make a blinde man ſee in the mid-day, an eye that hath not internall light cannot ſee. The Scriptures, in the old and new Teſtament, are the two great lights that God hath ordained to rule the Church; which, though they ſhine never ſo brightly, yet there is required an internall light in man, that they may be ſeene. A man may looke up to the heavens, ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> where God doth ſit, and yet not know God, nor ſee him ſhut up in heaven: So many men reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet ſee not God ſhut up in them. No man knowes what is in man but the Spirit of man, and wee have received the Spirit of God, that we might know the things that are given us of God: The Wiſdome of God hath given the Spirit to man, whereby hee is able to diſcerne. If ſo be a King ſhould write a Letter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102519:33"/>to his ſubjects in a ſtrange language, and not ſend his Secretary to interpret it, they were never the better; nor wee for the Scriptures without the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> wrote to the King of Judah for the Law; and withall hee deſired him to ſend him a man that might make him to underſtand it: So they that will underſtand the language of the Scriptures muſt have the Spirit of God. If a man had the Prophets themſelves to preach to him, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a man underſtand to ſalvation; why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can but teach the eare, they cannot teach the heart. When I cannot have <hi>Moſes</hi> to tell mee the meaning, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> give mee that Spirit that thou gaveſt to <hi>Moſes:</hi> And this is that which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that will underſtand muſt pray for: this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonders of thy Law:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>hide not thy Commandements from mee:</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If you, being evill, can give good things to your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give his holy Spirit to them that ask of him? Luk.</hi> 11.13. So that then wee ſhall ſee the ſecrets of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. If any man pray for the Spirit of God, he muſt not think it comes without means, and therefore neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect reading. It is Gods finger that preſſeth the diligent care of reading; and it is the means whereby wee may come to have the Spirit: you muſt not look to have the Spirit in your heart, unleſſe you have the Word in your mouth, that is, the continuall reading thereof; neither preferr a little eaſe before the Booke of God. Thou haſt no part in the Spirit, if thou haſt not a great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102519:33"/>deſire to have a great part in the knowledge of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. In the fourth place; Did God write it? Then ought wee to make application of every part of it, of the promiſes, and of the threatnings, and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, &amp;c. Of the promiſes, becauſe it was God that promiſed them, and hee will confirme and make them good: of the commandements, becauſe if thou diſobey them, he is a juſt God, and hee will be revenged of every contemner: of the threatnings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they had been written by man, a mans word might have beene contemned, but whither ſhall wee flee from God? Therefore think of this Word, and labour to apply it, and give obedience to it; they are Gods owne Lawes, <hi>and it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God;</hi> therefore let us feare and obey that which is Gods Commandement, leſt for our neglect he throw us to everlaſting deſtruction.</p>

               <p>THe laſt day wee ſpake concerning the Scriptures, and therein wee handled the Author that wrote them, and from whom they did flow; and you heard, it was from God himſelfe, and that by divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It remaineth then that wee ſhould ſpeake of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102519:34"/>ſecond thing that wee have thought fit to bee ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> The dignity of the Word, which hath two parts: the firſt, the Authority of it; the ſecond, the Sufficiencie of it, becauſe wee are to build on it, and to reſt upon it as the ground and rule of Faith: and theſe are the two things which wee will handle at this time. For the former of theſe,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the authority of the written word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is that by which it is authenticall, and worthy of credit in it ſelfe, being the divine and onely Canon and Rule for all things to bee beleeved and done.

If any man bring any other Doctrine, bid him not to thy houſe; where the word ſheweth, that there is no other word of any authority but this Word; thus the Word witneſſeth of it ſelfe; therefore it muſt be true: <hi>John</hi> 10.35. the Word <hi>cannot be broken,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt bee of that authority, worthy of credit in it ſelfe; and being divine, wee muſt beleeve it, and it muſt bee the Rule and Canon by which all things muſt bee done; And this is the proofe of the firſt point.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102519:34"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What ground have you for this, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are thus authenticall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There are theſe: Firſt, becauſe they are Gods word, to whom it belongs to appoint every one a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and rule, that muſt give them direction to all things to be beleeved and done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe God hath written them for this end, that they might be ſuch a rule that might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the Church, that men ſhould not dare to ſwerve from it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe this Word is the firſt divine truth of God himſelf.</p>
               <p>To explane theſe; firſt, they are Gods word, &amp;c.

Thou ſhalt keepe my ſtatutes: ſo that if we enquire into the ground, what the reaſon of the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, it is manifeſt, it is authenticall, becauſe it is the word of God: who ſhould teach me (ſaith Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>) the things that appertaine to heaven? God, and not man. Who can better teach me concerning God, then God? All other Divine things had need of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, ſaith <hi>Salvian:</hi> but onely theſe things ſpoken by God, need no more teſtimony: while therefore it is God that hath wrote this, and he onely hath Divine authority, therefore this muſt needs be of Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:102519:35"/>
               <p>The ſecond anſwer was thus much; becauſe that this was written by God, to that end, that the Church might alway have a rule, from which it ſhould not dare to ſwerve. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Take heed to my ſtatutes, turne not to the right hand, nor to the left:</hi> and that <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Theſe things were written, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope:</hi> therefore from hence it is manifeſt, that they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be a rule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe that this is the firſt divine trueth of God himſelfe; therefore it hath this name, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.17. <hi>thy Word is truth;</hi> with an emphaſis, that there is no truth but this: ſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. it is the foundation of the Church, it is builded upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets: we ſay it is the firſt truth of God himſelfe, becauſe it muſt be firſt beleeved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can beleeve by a divine faith any thing that is revealed in it; faith doth firſt ſpring out of it, and is laſt of all reſolved into it, and ſo it is the firſt truth. This is the principle of principles, and though it be not beleeved, yet it hath the ſame authority: gold is gold, though no man have it: the Sunne in the firſt day it was created, was to rule the day, and meaſure time though there was neither man nor beaſt to take notice of it. In the Gnomen of a diall, the ſhadow of it ſhewes the houres of the day though men ſleepe; principles in all Arts are to be granted, are not denied without groſſe abſurdities. Here are our firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; that there is a God, that God hath a Word, that the Scripture is the Word of God; theſe are and ought to be aſſented unto by whoſoever would be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102519:35"/>Chriſtian; the denying of any one of theſe, is to open the gate to Atheiſme, and all prophaneſſe: ſo then this is manifeſt, that this Word of God is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe then teacheth us, that then fals to the ground, the Doctrine of Popery, that tels us, that the Scriptures have no authority but from the Church: ſome have ſpoken very blaſphemouſly of the Word of God, one for all; the Preſident of the Councell of Trent ſaith, that the Scriptures have no more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then <hi>Eſops</hi> Fables, without authority from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and others ſay, they have no more authority then any other prophane books: others more moderate ſay, they have no more authority in them then they receive from the Church: the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not what authority the Church doth give to the Scriptures, but what authority they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the Church can but declare their authority, the Scriptures have it in themſelves, I had not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Scripture (ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi>)</p>
               <p>We never denied that the Church hath excellent Offices concerning the Scriptures; as firſt, it is to keep them and preſerve them; therefore the Church is compared to a publique Notary, like to the Court of Rowles; the Maſter of the Roles gives no authority to Records, but keepes them. Secondly, the Church is to publiſh the Scriptures; therefore ſhe is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a crier, and this is the fidelity of the crier, to publiſh the ſpeech of the Prince; and the Churches duty is to publiſh the Law of God. The third office it hath, is to diſcern the true Scriptures from forgeries,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102519:36"/>and apocryphall. It cannot make that which is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, Canonicall; but it hath a power in diſcerning which are Apocryphall, which Canonicall: as it is in a City, the Magiſtrates receiving a letter as from the Prince, out of their experience are able to diſcerne whether it be the Princes letter or not: ſo they that are Gods Miniſters, can do nothing but diſcerne the Word, they cannot give any authority to it: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Scripture hath authority in it ſelfe, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.20. It is the foundation of the Church, then the Church cannot giue authority unto it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe ſerves to admoniſh us, to receive the Scriptures for themſelves, for their owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not for any mans authority whatſoever; not for any mans perſon, nor upon the authority of the Church; for if we doe ſo, we cannot have true ſaving faith. Every man ought to receive the Scripture for its owne authority; not that any man ſhould condemn the authority of the Church, but he may not depend onely upon it, no not upon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, but muſt ſearch the Scriptures, to ſee whether it be ſo or no: we ought not to receive the teſtimony of any Church in the world, except it be grounded upon the Scripture: we will uſe that which <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith of the woman of Samaria (we may uſe the helpe of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) when ſhe told them what things Chriſt did, they beleeved, but when they came to Chriſt himſelfe, they beleeved not for her ſaying, but becauſe they heard him themſelves: ſo we uſe the authority of the Church, as a meanes to come to beleeve; but when we beleeve, let us not beleeve for the ſaying of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102519:36"/>Church, but for the Scriptures themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This is to admoniſh every man, when he hath received the Word, to know it is the truth of God, and therefore to labour to make it the Cannon of his faith, for the authority it hath in it ſelfe: we ought to examine our ſelves by this Word: Haſt thou done any thing that hath not this ground? repent of it; and for the time to come, labour to make this the Cannon of thy life, and the rule of thy obedience. Art thou tempted by thy owne corruptions, or by any other? aske them, Is there any ſuch Word that will give leave? if not, thou muſt beleeve and hold to this; for this is the Cannon by which thou oughteſt to do all things. <hi>Hierome</hi> complaines of ſome in his time, who did wreſt the Law to their owne wils, and not their wils to the Law; but we muſt be farre from this: for whoſoever <hi>walks after this rule, Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>mercy and peace ſhall be to him;</hi> but if he walke not after this rule, he ſhall have judgement mercileſſe.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>The next queſtion is, what is the ſufficiencie of this Word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, that it is that by which it is perfected, concerning all things neceſſary to ſalvation; that place which the Apoſtle hath, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. doth prove this; <hi>it is able to make the man of God wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> and therefore it is ſufficient: ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Thou ſhalt keepe all theſe Commandements, thou ſhalt adde naught thereto, nor take ought therefrom;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be perfect: that to which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken, muſt needs be perfect: alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>the Law of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102519:37"/>Lord is perfect, Revel.</hi> 22. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall adde unto this booke, God ſhall adde unto them the plagues that are written in this booke.</hi> Thus the Word teſtifies of it ſelfe; and therefore ſeeing the Word is true, it muſt needs be a perfect rule.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What Reaſon doe you ſhew for further proofe of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it was the written Will and teſtimony of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe after the Lord had given the Law in writing, the Jewes were never guided by any unwritten word.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles never proved their Doctrine by any unwritten word. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is the written Will and teſtimony of God; therefore we call theſe, the old and new Teſtament: a mans will after it is confirmed, no eſtate will admit to be altred; therefore if we may not alter mans will, much leſſe may we alter Gods.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is ſufficient, becauſe that after the Lord had given his Law in writing, the Jewes were never guided by traditions: before the giving of the Law, the truth went from hand to hand, but after that God had written the Law, they never came to him, but upon ſome eſpeciall occaſion: as for the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp;c. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth this, that there are ſome Catholiques ſpeake with great probability that the Jewes, after God had written the Law had no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, in the old Teſtament the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was hid, but in the new Teſtament it was made
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102519:37"/>more plaine: If God would teach the Jewes by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by the written Word, when it was more obſcure, much leſſe us, who have it more cleare.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe whatſoever Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, taught, they proved by the written Word; thus ſaith a Prophet, and thus ſaith the Pſalmes; nay, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Chriſt oppoſed traditions, when he found that their authority corrupted the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. but I ſay unto you, rejecting thoſe traditions, the true word of God is this: therefore the concluſion is, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are a perfect rule containing all things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe teacheth us, that then muſt fall to the ground, all unwritten traditions, the ground of all which is ſaid to be the inſufficiency of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but if the Scriptures be ſufficient, then traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have nothing to leane upon; but it is blaſphemie to thinke, that God would not perfect that Word he began, and therefore traditions are nothing. Oh! ſay they, the Scriptures doe not containe all fundamentall points for faith. To this I anſwer: If they had ſaid, the Scriptures doe not containe all the fundamentall points of their faith, I would willingly ſubſcribe to it; the word of God no where ſpeakes of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſours; the word no where ſpeakes of invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, prayer for the dead, indulgences and pardons, theſe things the Scripture doth not containe; but theſe are all of them contrary to the foundation; but we beleeve nothing as neceſſary to ſalvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Scripture. We doe not doubt but that the Saints kept many excellent ſpeeches, and ſayings of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102519:38"/>Chriſt, (as that in the Acts, as the Lord ſaid, it is a more bleſſed thing to give then to receive,) but if there be any ſuch tradition, that is not for ſubſtance to be found in the word, that we reject, becauſe the Scriptures are ſufficient; for the concluſion, we will end with a ſpeech of St. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> I ſeek in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, if I finde it not there, where ſhall I finde it? ſo may I ſay, if we find not traditions in the word, where ſhall we find them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This teacheth the Miniſters of God, that they muſt prove the Doctrine they teach unto the people; where ſhall they have that light, no where but from the word? they muſt not follow the viſion of any man, but only the word; wherein God hath comprized every thing that he will have his people taught: as it was in the creation, the light was at large before the Sunne was created; but after that was created, God incloſed all light in the Sun; ſo ſome time the word of God was taught from hand to hand, God informed ſome, and they taught o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but after that God had written the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all were to receive their light from theſe; there was none to be had any where elſe, and in this caſe it is manifeſt, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. Give attendance ſaith the Apoſtle to reading: in what? in the written word of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: ſo the Miniſters of God ſhould ſpeake of nothing elſe; and as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſaith, learne to teach that which hath been taught before, ſo ſhalt thou teach no new thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This ſeems to inſtruct men, if they want
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102519:38"/>counſell, if they want advice, where it is to be had; let them reſort to the booke of God, to the law and to the teſtimonies; this ſhall make them wiſe, this ſhall comfort them; the Scripture is able to make the man of God perfect to ſalvation, how much more a private man? That booke that can teach a man to be a Captaine, can teach a common ſouldier how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe; if he cannot finde ſufficiency in it, then he muſt blame himſelfe, for the defect is in his own part. Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> having given certaine rules, by which a man might underſtand the Scriptures, ſaith thus; if any man by theſe rules cannot underſtand the Scriptures, let him not blame the Scriptures, but let him blame himſelfe: as if I, ſaith the Father, do ſhew a man a ſtar with my finger, and he hath a weake ſight and cannot ſee it, let him not blame my finger, but his owne weakneſſe: for concluſion, every man ought to get a bible, what wants any man for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſpirituall comfort, that is not here? there is diſtreſſe, but here is a remedy for it; no diſcomfort, but here is a comfort, &amp;c. It is like the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhop, there is no wound but there is a remedy: but if a ſtranger come unto the Apothecaries ſhop, though all theſe things be there, yet he cannot tell where they are, but the Apothecary himſelfe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: ſo in the Scriptures, there are cures for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; there is comfort againſt any ſorrowes, and by conferring Chapter with Chapter, we ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them: the Scriptures are not wanting to us but we to our ſelves; let us be converſant in them, and we ſhall underſtand them, when great Clerks who are negligent, are kept from them.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the ground of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of ſo many things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the word, as were thought neceſſary: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines that we proceed to that which God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, firſt, concerning himſelfe. Secondly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his will. Firſt, that there is a God. Secondly, that there is but one God. Thirdly, what this one God is, in the unity of Eſſence, and trinity of perſons, and now concerning theſe.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What doth the word teach us concerning God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, firſt, that there is a God; for the proofe of this, my text ſhall ſerve for many: he that comes to God, muſt beleeve that he is, and that he is the rewarder of them that ſeek him; alſo the firſt of <hi>Gen.</hi> hath this many times, <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created &amp;c.</hi> And in the verſes following, <hi>God ſaw, that all that he had created was exceeding good.</hi> Therefore it ſhall be needleſſe for me to bring more proofes, for all men confeſſe there is a God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What reaſons have you to confirme this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be divers reaſons; firſt in man: ſecondly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102519:39"/>man; within man the very being of body and ſoule with the powers and parts of them: and ſecondly, the terrors of conſcience when they have done ill, and joy and comfort when they have done well: theſe and the like works in man doe manifeſt that there is a God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, without man, the wonderfull frame of the world was not made by it ſelfe, nor by nature, nor by man, therefore by God; with the motions that are in it, each of theſe we will explane: that theſe proves, that there is a God, appeares by the bodies of men, whence have they themſelves? of themſelves? No, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108. <hi>It is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves;</hi> It appeares manifeſtly in that a man cannot comprehend one part of his body, he knowes not himſelf, nor the ſeveral ſecrets that God hath made in him; but it may be ſayd though a man made not himſelf, yet his parents did; no, nor his parents: becauſe his parents did not know what they did beget and conceive; but if parents were the cauſe, then they ſhould know the effect: therfore it was God that made them; Their ſoules are made by him, who is above reaſon; there is nothing that hath reaſon but men and Angels, but they made not the ſoule, and nothing is above reaſon, but God; This is apparant for the body, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.4. <hi>He that made the eare, ſhall he not heare?</hi> it was God that planted the eare, and not man. And for the ſoule, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. <hi>The ſpirit returnes to God that gave it. God made man, and he breathed into him the breath of life,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>and he became a living ſoule.</hi> Wherupon the Poet <hi>Arratas</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:102519:40"/>ſpeakes, ſaith, that we are of the generation of God, becauſe we have our ſoules from him, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with reaſon and knowledge, and in this reſpect he is called the father of ſpirits; ſo that if we looke to the beginning of man, when he was firſt endued with wiſdome and reaſon, and made with noble qualities, it appeares that there is a God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſecond ground is in mans ſelf; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of man when he hath done ill is full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, all men are ſo: <hi>Adam</hi> hid himſelfe: <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>Sinners in Sion are afrayd, feare hath ſuppreſſed the hypocrites.</hi> And this is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.15. <hi>They were afrayd where no feare was;</hi> that is, where no outward cauſe of feare was; conſcience the deputy of God did terrifie them; This was that which did fill <hi>Iudas</hi> ſo full of terrors; Yea, but ſay ſome, they may feare leſt thoſe things they have done, ſhould come to the knowledge of the Magiſtrate, and ſo law ſhould take hold of them; I anſwer, this adds to their feare: but <hi>Adam</hi> had none to feare, becauſe he was the firſt: <hi>David</hi> had none to feare, becauſe he was king and ſo above all; but yet the deputy of God was in them, and that made them afraid: to add to this, if a man commit a thing in the wilderneſſe where no man knowes it, yet he is afraid, for ſomtimes he tels it in a frenſie, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teme in ſleepe, as the Prophet <hi>Eſai</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 66.14. <hi>Enforced by the worm in them that never dies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the comfort that it gives unto men when they have done wel, when they know the acceptation of their owne works, and live in expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102519:40"/>and this is not only when they have done wel in the ſight of men, but alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their left hand knoweth not what their right hand doth; nay when men mock at them and ſcorne them, as <hi>Mychall</hi> ſcorned <hi>David,</hi> then they have joy; yea the Martyrs have laid downe their lives rejoycing: whence comes this but from God? the Apoſtle ſpeakes to this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>You ſuffered with joy the ſpoiling of your goods: why? becauſe you know you have in heaven a better and a more enduring ſubſtance;</hi> all which proves that there is a God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is without man, and that is from the wonderfull frame of the world; it had a beginning but it was not made by nature, nor by man, nor by it ſelfe, nor by chance; It had a beginning, and therfore ſubject to alteration, and change, and therefore it made not it ſelfe, nor came it by chance. If a man come into a ſtrange place, and ſee a ſmall cottage, he will ſay it was made by ſome body; much more, if a man look upon the frame of the world, he cannot thinke it was made by it ſelfe; well, who ſhould make it? it ſelfe? or nature? or man? Firſt, chance made it not, which is a caſual concurrence of things, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature made it not, for if it did, then there ſhould be a naturall reaſon of all things in the world; but there are Millions of things in the world of which none can give a reaſon; as the ebbing and flowing of the Sea. The maſter of reaſon could not find it out, &amp; therfore ſayd, becauſe I cannot finde thee, thou ſhalt find me, and caſt himſelfe into the Sea: who can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the colors in the Rainbow, and who can give a reaſon for the heate of a mans ſtomack, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102519:41"/>digeſteth all things that it receives, and conſumes not it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Neither did man make it, it was made for man, and he was brought into it as a gueſt, therefore man could not make it; beſides, there is ſuch skill in the frame of the world, that man could not do it; and Chriſt teacheth us, that man hath not power to make a haire of his head white or blacke, much leſſe to make ſuch an earth, and ſuch an heaven as there is, therefore it could not be made by man; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>the inviſible things of God are ſeen by the creation of the world. Rom.</hi> 1.20. Hereby they that have doubted whether there was a God, have been brought to confeſſe one: for <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that when he ſaw a Butterfly or a gnat buffing about him, he confeſſed that there was a God; becauſe that ſo little a creature could not elſe make ſo great a noiſe: to adde to theſe, the motions that are in things, it is the reaſon that Philoſophers have had to prove, that there muſt be a God; becauſe all inferiour things, muſt be moved by ſuperiours: that as the pulſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a mans eie, or reaſon to the heart, ſo theſe to God; eſpecially, when all theſe things move to one principall end, though things have two or three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet all comes to one end, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>God made all things for his own glory;</hi> ſo that by theſe arguments we have proved that there is a God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This ſerves to confute all Atheiſts, ſuch as deny that there is a God, and ſay that religion is nothing but a meer invention to keep men in awe; Saint <hi>Auſtin;</hi> in his confeſſion, ſaith; If there be any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102519:41"/>that deny God, I know not what to ſay, I know not with what manner of arguments to go to them; but I ſhould offend in ſpeaking to them: <hi>Tully</hi> in his book of the nature of God, makes mention of one <hi>Protago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> who wrote a booke, and in the beginning of the booke, he wrote thus: The Gods whether they be or not, I know not: the <hi>Athenians</hi> abhorred this, and for this, they baniſhed him out of the Country, and burnt his bookes in a publique aſſembly: this I ſay, if there be any Atheiſts amongſt us, I could wiſh they were baniſhed the Court, and Country; I adde this further, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeakes, there are no Atheiſts though there would be ſome; if any ſay there is no God, they lie; though they ſay it in the day time, yet in the night when they are alone they denie it; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſome deſperately harden themſelves, yet if God doth but ſhew himſelfe terrible to them, they confeſſe him. Many of the heathen, and others, have denied that there is a God, yet when they were in diſtreſſe, they did fall down and confeſſe him, as <hi>Diagoras</hi> that grand Atheiſt, when he was troubled with the ſtrangullion, acknowledged a diety which he had denied; theſe kinde of Atheiſts, I leave to the mercy of God, of which I doubt it whether there be any for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe, ſerves to teach every man to bethinke himſelfe, and to humble himſelfe, for theſe Atheiſticall thoughts, in which he hath called into queſtion, and diſputed whether there be a God, or no: Brethren know thus much, if thou beeſt a man that doeſt believe, thou canſt not be perfectly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102519:42"/>without theſe thoughts, ariſing out of the ſeed of thy owne infidelity, to call into queſtion, whether there be a God: for the divel out of his malice which he beares to God, labors to corrupt men in this, that ſo they may call their faith into queſtion: It may be a man by grace may reſiſt theſe thoughts: but know, that there is no man ſo reſiſteth a temptation of Sathan, but that it leaves ſome filth behind it: a man cannot perfectly reſiſt him by reaſon of his weakenes, therefore every man ought to humble himſelfe; for he that is leaſt troubled with them hath leaſt faith; but he that wraſtleth with them, and humbleth himſelfe for them, may have comfort. Therefore labour to ſtrengthen thy ſelfe againſt theſe, that if they come, they may be but as a flaſh of fire. For the concluſion of this uſe, what ſhall a man do? even as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith (teaching how we may make the divel nought to himſelfe, and good to us) labour for more ſtrength by his temptations; It grieves the divel to ſee us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by him; if we were watchfull againſt occaſions, and temptations, and reſiſted them, by this meanes we ſhould grow ſtrong in faith, and gaine by him: and to this end the Apoſtle ſaith, reſiſt the divel, and he will fly from thee.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What doth the word teach us concerning God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That there is but one true God, it is manifeſt where in my text: he that comes to God, muſt believe that God is, and that there is but one God: when God ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaak</hi> he ſayd, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed, So <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.6. <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt, and beſides me there is no God.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102519:42"/>Iohn</hi> 17.3 <hi>This is eternall life, to know thee to be the onely true God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. Though there be many that are called gods and lords, yet unto us there is but one onely true God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What Reaſons are there of this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are three: Firſt, from him are all things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe there can be but one Infinite.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe there is but one Omnipotent.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: Becauſe from him are all things: thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons with the Gentiles, that <hi>from him, for him, and by him, are all things, Rom.</hi> 11.36. If all things be from him, then there can be but one for all; other things come from him, as maine roots have their firſt originall from one root; ſo all beings have their being from God, who is the firſt being. And as all things come from him, ſo all things returne to him againe, and ſerve to manifeſt his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therefore he is called the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe (as the Maſter of reaſon ſaith) there can be but one infinite being and wiſdome, and that muſt be the firſt mover, and that is, he that fils heaven and earth, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 23.23. <hi>I fill hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth:</hi> and therefore there can be but one God.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon is, becauſe there can be but one Omnipotent; It appeares manifeſtly that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be many: for (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſpeakes) if there be two, they muſt be equall, and then they agree, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree; if they agree, then one of them is ſuperiour;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102519:43"/>if they diſagree, then there will be a confuſion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followes, that there can be but one; for (as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith) a King cannot endure a fellow; no more can God endure a copartner: when was there heard that two Kings raigned together, but the one ſought the overthrow of the other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This ſerves to overthrow the multitude of gods that the heathen have had and worſhipped, and the hereticks have invented. It ſhewes, that they were fictions of their owne braines, becauſe they made a multitude of them: the true God hath not his name, nay, he will not have his name given to another; a true Husband cannot endure a fellow; a true Mother cannot endure the parting of her childe: this argues that the Gentiles gods, were falſe gods, becauſe if they might be gods, they cared not how many there were. And that was the reaſon why the <hi>Romans</hi> refuſed Chriſt, becauſe they would have their gods with him, and he would be worſhipped alone, without them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This teacheth us from whence it is, that the world continues, and is not deſtroyed; not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a God, but becauſe there is but one God, and he alwayes preſerves it: Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, as it is with the body, If God doe forſake it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue; ſo is it with the world, if God did not uphold it, it would come to nothing: he ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the world is like unto a ſhip, the Marriners are the men, the ſayles are the heaven; why doth this ſhip never periſh? becauſe there is but one Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; if there were two governours, the ſhip muſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102519:43"/>needs periſh; for while the one would hoyſt up ſayle, the other would caſt ancor, and ſo there would be a confuſion. Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith, if there were as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Governours and Coronels in one Armie as ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the Armie would ſoone be confounded; this is the ſafety of an Army, that there is but one Generall, and ſo all are preſerved; ſo is it of the world, that there is but one God.</p>
               <p>The third Uſe is for matter of practice, to reſtraine men from wronging one another; becauſe there is but one God. It is not my uſe, but the Prophets, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Have not we all one Father?</hi> and the Apoſtle in the new Teſtament exhorts, <hi>that we live in peace, &amp;c.</hi> he addes, <hi>becauſe there is but one God, Father of us all, &amp;c.</hi> ſo he that is about to injury another, ought thus to reaſon with himſelfe; there is but one God, and he is his God as well as mine: and if any man injury me, ſhall I goe about to take revenge? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall I ſinne againſt God, for there is but one God: Well might it be, if an Engliſh man and a ſtranger ſhould injury one another in a ſtrange place, they might returne revenge, becauſe they are not both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one ſupreme Governour; but we may not do ſo, we have all one God: a Maſter of a family that hath two ſervants fallen out, is moſt angry with him that ſtrikes the ſecond blow: ſo with him that offers wrong, God is angry, but he is much more offended with him that takes revenge: therefore we ought to reaſon thus with our ſelves, he is his God and my God, therefore I may not tranſgreſſe againſt him: and this is not onely generall, but particular, for the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102519:44"/>Maſter to the ſervant, for the King to the Subject; we have but one God, and his God is my God; I may not wrong him, for he will puniſh me, and defend him: and this is the argument that <hi>Iob</hi> uſes, <hi>If I did deſpiſe the counſell of my maid;</hi> that is, if I was a tyrant over them, and would not heare them ſpeake, but would have done what I pleaſed: what was the ground that reſtrained him? he that made them, made me; therefore deale equally with your ſervants; you have but one God, and there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and you; therefore let every man take heed of himſelfe, eſpecially that ye tranſgreſſe not one againſt another; and every one ſhall receive of God as he hath done: And ſo much for this time.</p>

               <p>THE word of God, the fountaine of knowledge, teacheth us; firſt, concerning God himſelfe: Secondly, concerning the will of God.</p>
               <p>Concerning God himſelfe, we propoſed three
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102519:44"/>heads: Firſt, That there is a God: Secondly, That there is but one God. Thirdly, What this God is. Concerning the two former; That there is a God, and that there is but one God, we have already ſpoken: now it remaines that we proceede to the third; What this God is. The nature of man is ſo weake and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that it is altogether impoſſible for it to finde what God is; and that made the Naturaliſts ſay, that it was no eaſie thing by nature to finde that there is a God; but to finde out what he is, is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: The light that we have in his Word is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and we can ſee but in part, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: God hath ſhewed himſelfe unto us, as he did to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by his back parts; that is, ſo much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as we may be ſaved by; and no more may we ſeeke after, and be ſaved; and therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, and Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> building upon him, <hi>Secret things belong to God;</hi> he hath kept them to himſelfe, and what things God hath kept ſecret, we may not looke after; and thoſe things he hath revealed, we may not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; therefore we muſt follow the Word and the light of it, and goe along therein as others have done before us, who laboured to ſee this God. For me to tell you the many deſcriptions, the ancient Fathers have given of God, would take up a great deale of time, therefore to paſſe by all theſe, and to come to that which may give us profitable knowledge.</p>
               <p>The firſt Queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What doth this word teach us concerning God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It teacheth us what he is, namely one ſpirituall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102519:45"/>Eſſence, moſt perfect, diſtinguiſhed into three perſons: this diſcription of God is the ground whereupon we muſt lay that which followes, wherein you muſt ſee that he is an Eſſence; ſecondly, that he is but one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; thirdly, that he is a ſpirituall Eſſence; fourthly, that he is moſt perfect: this queſtion and anſwer we will explane in other queſtions and anſwers; I come then to the firſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Namely; what is this that is ſayd to be an Eſſence? or why is it ſaid to be an Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is, that Gods Eſſence is that by which he is, and exiſteth true God: To explaine this, it appeares out of theſe words that I have read, that <hi>Moſes</hi> being ſent by God to Iſrael, that he might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them when they ſaid, who ſent thee, God ſaith, I am, that I am; I am, and Eſſence are all one: for though in Scripture this word Eſſence is not to be found, yet in ſence and meaning it is; this is manifeſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8. <hi>God ſaith of himſelfe, I am, &amp;c.</hi> Moreover, this is manifeſted to us by that name which is given to God, even Jehovah and Jah, names that are not given to any that are not Gods by nature, though Gods by office; that theſe two names are alwaies given to him that is God by nature, I might ſhew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite examples, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.18. <hi>Thou whoſe name alone is Iehovah, art the moſt high over all the earth.</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength:</hi> where the word is (Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah Jah:) Now this word Jehovah is derived of a root or Radix, that ſignifies (to be) and thereupon it comes to paſſe, that he is called <hi>(I am.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is God ſuch an Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102519:45"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he exiſteth abſolutely of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Secondly, becauſe his Eſſence is eternall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and ever the ſame. Thirdly, becauſe it gives an Eſſence and being to his Word and Promiſes. Fourthly, becauſe he gives an Eſſence and being to his Creatures: and of all theſe in their place.</p>
               <p>Eſſence or being, is common to God and his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: theſe foure things make the difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, That he exiſteth abſolutely of himſelf: this appeares by many places, <hi>Iſai</hi> 43.10. <hi>You ſhall know and beleeve me;</hi> that is, you ſhall underſtand that I am, and how? namely, of my ſelfe: for before me there was no God, neither ſhall there be after me: ſo he is abſolute of himſelfe. So alſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.38. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am:</hi> our Saviour ſpeaking of his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſaith, that he was long before <hi>Abraham,</hi> though in reſpect of his humanity he deſcended from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> things created have their Eſſence and being, but they have it not of themſelves, but from God who hath it of himſelfe: hereupon it is ſaid, an eſſence and being are both one in God: and this is the firſt ground why he is called an Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe his eſſence is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, immutable, and therefore alwayes the ſame. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.2. <hi>Thou art from everlaſting, thy yeeres never faile:</hi> according to this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, Iames</hi> 1.13. <hi>With him there is no changing nor ſhadow of changing.</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, the true and ſole Eſſence is the Eſſence of God; created things have their Eſſence from another, he from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and they ſometimes weare not, but he was ever
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102519:46"/>the ſame, and therefore properly hath this name given unto him.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon is, becauſe he gives a being to his Word and Promiſes; and is therefore called an Eſſence, even an Eſſence, giving being to others: for in the accompliſhment of them, he gives them a reall being. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. I was knowne to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> by my name Almighty; that is, I was knowne to be almighty, when I created the world of nothing; and I was knowne Almighty in deſtroying the world againe: I was knowne by my name Almighty, when I bleſſed <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet was not I known by my name Jehovah, in giving a being unto my Promiſes; that is, in bringing them out of Egypt; I will now make that a reall being; therefore after God had delivered them, he ſaith, <hi>I am Iehovah, that brought thee out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, he doth not promiſe, and others performe; but he promiſeth and performeth himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe he gives a being to all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in their ſeverall kindes; ſome have a bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome have a lively; ſome a ſenſitive, ſome a reaſonable being; all theſe have it from God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44.24, <hi>I ſtretch the heavens, I the Lord made all theſe:</hi> this is that the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>through him, and for him, and by him, are all things.</hi> It is he that gives us a being, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17 28. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, by his benefit all have life, but no man is beneficiall to him; he it is that is maker of all: therefore he is properly called an Eſſence, becauſe he hath his being from himſelfe, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102519:46"/>all other things from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This teacheth us to put a difference between the true God, and falſe gods. The true God is one Eſſence, thoſe have no ſuch Eſſence; there be many gods which bare ſuperſtition hath invented, but it never gave them a being; but the true God hath a being of himſelfe; they worſhip thoſe (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) which by nature are no gods, and therefore they are falſe gods; they had a being from man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are beholding to man for it: and thence it appeares they are no gods; why? they have no eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall being: even the Heathen Poets which were the Prophets of thoſe gods, ſpeake of their manner, and parents, and birth; and if they had parents from whom they received beginning, they muſt have an end; for every thing that hath his beginning; muſt have an end. Againe, they that have a being and have no life, are falſe gods; for they have their being from man, and the errors of man, ſo they are gods made with hands; therefore it is manifeſt they are falſe gods, and ſuperſtitious men give them falſe names, as <hi>Salvian</hi> obſerved; that in his time, they gave their Idols celeſtiall names, yet were not theſe the true God, becauſe he that is the true God hath his being of himſelfe, and depends not upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo much for this uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This teacheth us that we ſhould ſerve this God with fear, becauſe we have our being from him; he is an Eſſence that hath his being from himſelfe, we had our being from him; we hold not our being but by him; we ought therefore to ſerve him by way
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102519:47"/>of Chriſtian Policy that he may continue our being, we ought to ſerve him with feare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. Againe, he hath given us a being, and though he hath made us, he hath no need of us; and therefore we ought to feare him; God hath no need of our ſervice. Thou that art a maſter, thy ſervant hath need of thee, and thou haſt need of thy ſervant, that he may ſerve thee; but God is the true God, and hath no need of any man, but every man hath need of him, therefore it is neceſſary that every man ſhould returne his being to him. Againe, he hath no need of mans piety, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes; can a man be profitable to God, there is no benefit that a man can yeeld to God, but man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all from him, and he may take all away at his pleaſure, and therefore we ought to ſerve him; no man will ſay that God had need of us: If a man goes to a River &amp; drinks to ſatisfie his thirſt, wil a man ſay the River had need of him, no but that he had need of the River? ſo here: therefore every one ought to ſerve this God with feare: for that God who made thee a man, might have made thee a beaſt, or a ſnake, but hath not; and therefore ſeeing we doe but draw our breathes from him, there is reaſon that we ſhould feare him, and ſerve him, that we may have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our lives here, and eternall life hereafter, and this ſhall ſuffice for this uſe.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>The next queſtion is, whether this Eſſence be one or many?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is made that there is but one ſimple Eſſence without diviſion, or partition; we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this my text, I am, that I am; here is no more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102519:47"/>but one ſimple Eſſence without any partition, like unto this is <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. And they ſhall worſhip one God. The meaning is, that after Chriſt ſhall come, the Gentiles with the Jewes ſhall all worſhip one and the ſame true God. And this is that which Chriſt ſpeaks, I and the Father are one; this argues a plurality of perſons, in that he ſaith, I &amp; the Father, but when he comes to the Eſſence, he ſaith, are one; and there he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the ſingular number, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bare witneſſe in heaven; the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, theſe three are one.</hi> Where the Apoſtle doth ſhew that theſe three perſons are one in Eſſence.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Seeing there are three perſons, why ſhould there be but one Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, becauſe there can be but one God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe this Eſſence is moſt perfect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe theſe three are alike Coeternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, there can be but one God, therefore there can be but one Eſſence: for it is a true poſition that the learned have, that the Eſſence of God is God, therefore if there were many Eſſences there would be many Gods; but there can be but one God, as hath beene ſhewed: marke the reaſon, if the Eſſence were devided, there muſt be three Gods, for where the Eſſence is devided there are three, as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are three; why? becauſe their Eſſence is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but in the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt, theſe are not three Eſſences, but one Eſſence, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith; this God is the true God, which is ſo ſimple that he cannot have parts, and ſo one that he cannot have number, therefore if he be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102519:48"/>but one God, he muſt needs be but one Eſſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe this Eſſence is moſt perfect, in the higheſt degree; that which is perfect in the higheſt degree can be but one, becauſe that one muſt containe all perfections; If there ſhould be many, there could be none moſt perfect; becauſe in every one, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or ſome degree of perfection would be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therfore theſe three perſons being in the higheſt degree perfect, can be but one Eſſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe they are all eternall alike; that is manifeſt: for it is a maine Article of Religion to be believed, that the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt are Coeternall: there can be but one eternall; and wheras the Father is before the Sonne, in regard of order, yet not in time; they are alike eternall, therfore there are not ſeverall Eſſences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. The firſt uſe ſerves to condem all thoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that denied the diety of the Son, and holy Ghoſt, &amp; yet denied not ſimply that they were God, but that they were Gods by nature: we ſay they are heere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: for if the God head be but one Eſſence, it muſt needs follow that theſe perſons are Gods by nature, or not at all.</p>
               <p>In created things, they that have a like nature are ſayd to be the ſame Eſſence; as in birds, beaſts, and men; whatſoever hath the nature of a man, we ſay it is a man, though he have not the ſame ſingular nature that others have, yet we ſay he hath the nature of a man: there is difference, as the Learned obſerve, betweene the like Eſſence, and the ſame Eſſence; he that hath the like Eſſence of ſome one man, hath not the ſame
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102519:48"/>Eſſence of that man; but the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, are one and the ſame Eſſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2. Here is direction for our faith, what we muſt believe of God, if we will be ſaved; we muſt believe aright in God: and we cannot believe aright, unles we underſtand him what he is; and here our knowledge, and faith muſt diſtinguiſh theſe three perſons one from another, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, but yet our faith may not divide the Eſſence; we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Eſſence from the perſons that doe ſubſiſt in it; therfore if we believe aright, though there be three perſons; yet there is but one Eſſence; and we muſt hold this as a maine Article of Chriſtian faith; <hi>Salvian</hi> ſayth, ſpeaking of the Creed, he that denies the firſt Article, overthrowes all the reſt: ſo I ſay, he that holds not this, hath no faith at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 3. The third uſe is this, here is matter of comfort to thoſe that are Gods; and that which is the eſpeciall meanes of comfort, is prayer: they may come boldly to the throne of grace, and go away aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they are heard, becauſe there is but one Eſſence; you will aske me how it follows upon this, I explaine it thus; they that pray, and pray aright, cannot pray to God the Father, but in the name of the Sonne; neither can they pray of themſelves, but the ſpirit makes requeſt for them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. thoſe that the Father commands to pray, and the Son praies for, and the ſpirit helpes; ſhall they not have aſſurance, ſeeing that God entreates himſelfe for them: for prayers are made to the Father, through the Sonne, and by the holy Ghoſt. Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102519:49"/>Chriſt praies for us, and in us, and is praied to of us: Chriſt prayes for us as he is our Prieſt; he prayes in us, as he is our head: and he is prayed to of us, as he is our God; now no doubt but we ſhall prevaile, when we haue the Sonne a mediator, and the ſpirit of God our helper, therefore we may goe away with aſſurance: for if a great Prince would not only vouchſafe to let poore creatures put ut Petitions for them, and his Son to preſent them to him, but alſo appoint his ſecretary to drawe their petitions for them, and his Sonne to preſent them to him, undoubtedly they ſhould ſpeed; and therefore they ſhould goe with aſſurance: ſo God vouchſafes this mercy, that he will let us come to put up our petition to him: and he gives us his ſpirit to make them, his Sonne to preſent them, and theſe three are one; and therefore we may goe with boldneſſe, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth: if any man pray to God and uſe that prayer his Sonne made, he may have good hope to be heard: and we ſay he may be aſſured to be heard when he makes that prayer which the ſpirit of God made; and thus have we comfort in this, that the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, are but one Eſſence.</p>

               <p>THE laſt day, you heard theſe things concerning God, that he is one ſpirituall Eſſence, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into three perſons. In which deſcription of God, I have ſhewed you that we are to ſpeake of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Firſt, that he is an Eſſence. Secondly, that he is one Eſſence. Thirdly, that his Eſſence is ſpiriuall. Fourthly, that it is perfect, of his Eſſence, and that he is but one, was ſpoken of the laſt day. Now to proceed to the third, viz. that it is a ſpirituall Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence according to our order, the queſtion and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſtand thus;</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant, when it is ſaid, that God is a ſpirituall Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> That God is a ſpirit, &amp; his nature, &amp; ſubſtance is indiviſible, and corporeall; we may come to ſee what he is, by that which he is not; as it is not poſſible to tell what God is, ſo it is hard to deſcribe what a ſpirit is; but yet by that which he is not, we may ſee in part what he is, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, to know what God is, is the ſafeſt way to know what he is not. To
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102519:50"/>prove this deſcription of God, that he is a Spirit, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Lord is a ſpirit inviſible,</hi> that a ſpirit is inviſible, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.34 <hi>ſee, feele me, for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as you ſee I have,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>To God only wiſe, inviſible:</hi> and he is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by negatives: <hi>Col</hi> 1.15. <hi>The Image of the inviſible God;</hi> where it appeares, that God is a Spirit, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incorporeall.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How do you confirme this by reaſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By three reaſons, Firſt; becauſe he is moſt ſimple without compoſition. Secondly, becauſe he cannot be contained in any ſpace, or place. Thirdly, becauſe he is inſenſible, he cannot be perceived by any ſenſe; therefore he muſt needs be inviſible, and incorporeall; to explane every one of theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Firſt, that God is moſt ſimple, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compoſition, as you have heard out of Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> he is ſo ſimple, that there are no parts in him: if he have no parts, then he muſt needs be ſimple, and without compoſition; and indeed of what ſhould he be compounded? He was before all things; therefore neceſſarily, he muſt be without all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; all created ſpirits are without bodies, but all created ſpirits have a kinde of compoſition, but God hath none: all created ſpirits, both Angels, and ſoules of men, have a kinde of compoſition, they are compounded of act, and power; but God hath neither matter, nor forme, nor is compounded of act, and power, therefore he is without compoſition, and it may well be ſaid, that he is a ſpirit inviſible and incorporeall.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:102519:50"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. The ſecond reaſon is; becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be comprehended, or contained in any place, or ſpace; corporeall things, are comprehended, as the bodies that are in this place may be circumſcribed the reaſon is; becauſe they have length, bredth, and depth; but no ſuch thing is in God: I ſay all ſpirits are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, and free from circumſcription, then much more this Spirit; this is that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.2, <hi>Doth God indeed dwell among men, behold the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of heavens are not able to containe thee.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.24. <hi>I fill heaven and earth.</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, God is ſuch an eſſence as is ſpirituall, and is in every place, and excluded out of no place, nor included in any place, but fills every place, therefore, he muſt needs be a ſpirit inviſible and incorporeall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe he is inſenſible, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low he is a ſpirit; for ſpirits are not ſubject to ſenſes; ſo you heard out of <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. <hi>feel, ſee, a ſpirit hath not fleſh &amp; bones as you ſee me have:</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have not ſenſible qualities, which are the object of mens ſenſes; much leſſe hath God any ſuch qualities; in God there is no mutability, nor change, therefore he is not ſubject to ſenſe; for whatſoever is ſubject to ſenſe is mutable; that which is the ſnarpeſt ſenſe, and beſt able to comprehend, is the eies, but this cannot comprehend God; God is infinite, &amp; therefore cannot poſſibly fal under finit ſenſe of man; that which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſenſe, is ſubject to mans underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding; but God exceeds mans underſtanding: he is great; we know him not, ſaith <hi>Elihu:</hi> we know him no futher then he doth reveale himſelfe, and when we know the moſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102519:51"/>how little of him do we perceive? Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, from hence, that God is a Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt uſe: if this be ſo, it reproves the error of thoſe heretiques called the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phite,</hi> that taught, that God had a bodily ſhape; they are confuted by this, that God is a Spirit, in whom there cannot be any ſuch thing; <hi>Ob.</hi> Yea, but ſay they, the Scriptures give theſe things to God, hands eies, eares, and feet. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are given to God by a Metaphor, by a kinde of borrowed ſpeech; namely, that which man doth with theſe members, God doth without them, and theſe are given to God in Scripture for our capacity; when we ſay God hath a head, feet, or other members, it is by effect, and not by nature; we ſay that God is life (ſaith St. <hi>Ierom</hi>) wiſdome, and hath eies, &amp;c. we ſay God hath eies, becauſe he is wholly an eie, and ſees every thing, in every place; and ſo we ſay he hath feet, becauſe he is wholly feet, he is in every place, and doth behold all things, and workes all things: <hi>Obje.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, that man is made after the Image of God; <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is indeed but not in bodily ſhape, but in the ſoule, in righteouſneſſe, in wiſdome, holineſſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, &amp;c. therefore theſe are but cavells of theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, this reproves any repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, in any Images, either internall, in the minde, by thoughts, or externall by Pictures: there cannot be any repreſentation of God, for God is a ſpirit, and a ſpirit cannot be repreſented by any groſſe or earthly matter; much leſſe can God, who is more ſpirituall then ſpirits: It is not befitting his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102519:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>Majeſty to to be pictured; and hereupon it is, that he forbids all repreſentations of him; neither did the people of God, (howſoever God did appear to them in bodily ſhapes) at any time in any manner repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him: the molten Image is a teacher of lies, ſaith the Prophet; it is the originall of divers errors, which they have juſtly fallen into, and juſtly deſerve to fall into, that will not ſeeke God in his word, but in painted walls: from theſe the people of God have been preſerved, becauſe they have ever ſought him in his word; and as all outward repreſentations of God, ſo all inward conceits of him, beſides the word, are unlawfull; to abſtaine from Images is eaſie, but to abſtaine from inward thoughts is hard; and that partly by reaſon of the corruption of our natures, and partly by the ſuggeſtion of the divell: therefore we ſhould be more carefull, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of God as like to any thing; nor to make any reſemblance of him in our minde: and then this is the comfort that a man hath, that though theſe thoughts come, if he diſlike them, and ſtrive againſt them, they are infirmities that God will cure them, and not condemne us for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This teacheth us, when we are about the worſhip of God, to thinke of the nature of God, what he is; that he is a ſpirit, without diviſion, or compoſition; and though we ſhould glorifie God with our bodies, for God will have them, yet eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we ſhould doe it with our ſpirits, which God in a ſpeciall manner requires: why? becauſe that is moſt agreeable to his nature, and moſt pleaſing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102519:52"/>to him; he that will ſerve a man, muſt labour to do it principally outwardly; but he that will ſerve God, muſt do it eſpecially inwardly, in the heart; if he do it in the heart, he cannot but do it in the outward man; man reſpects more the outward, then the inward; but God reſpects more the inward, then the outward: if a man worſhip God in ſpirit, though he be hindred in the outward by occaſions, God wil excuſe it. God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excuſes a man, for the want of inward affections, but hath oftentimes taken the inward, when the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hath been wanting: S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, there is this difference between God and man; man requires the outward, and doth not ſo much looke at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but God requires the inward; man can go no further then the outward, but God meaſures the outward ſervice, by the inward affections: there is no true ſervice in the outward, where the inward is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; therefore when thou commeſt to praier, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word, or ſinging of Pſalmes, whom haſt thou to deal withall, with God who is a ſpirit? then thy worſhip muſt be ſpirituall: if thou haſt a mouth to ſpeake to God in praier, thou muſt have a mouth in thy heart alſo; elſe thou art but an hypocrite, and art abhorred of him: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, praiſe the Lord O my ſoule! and all that is within me, praiſe his holy name: therefore with thy outward ſervice, thou muſt joine the inward, or elſe thy ſervice, is but a ſtinking thing to him.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>The next queſtion is, what meane you by that when you ſay, he is moſt perfect?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:102519:52"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is, that he is ſufficiently perfect, and needs nothing out of himſelfe, nor retaines any thing from any other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>I am God al-ſufficient, walk before me:</hi> there God ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> I am God in my ſelfe, and out of my ſelfe: the ſame phraſe is often uſed in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the God al-ſufficient be with thee, when <hi>Izaack</hi> bleſſed his Sonne, and in reſpect of this he is called the happy God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11. the Goſpell is called a happy Goſpel, and in the 6. chap. 15. verſe, <hi>hee is happy, becauſe hee is al-ſufficient in himſelf, Pſal.</hi> 16.12. <hi>thou art my Lord, and all my well doeing extendeth not to thee:</hi> God needs nothing, whatſoever a man doeth, it is nothing to him; he made all mankinde, God is not worſhipt with mens hands, as if he had need of any thing, ſo that every part of this deſcription is proved that he is ſufficient and perfectly happy in himſelfe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Have you any grounds for this you ſay?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We have three, firſt becauſe he was thusſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and happy, before there was any creature made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe he is the author and cauſe of all good, and perfection in all creatures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that good and perfection that is in the creature, was firſt and moſt perfect in him; theſe we will explane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, before there was any creature made he was ſufficient, and happy: then it follows that hee muſt bee perfect of himſelfe; for of whom ſhould he have this perfection? that he was thus, we prove, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. <hi>Before the mountaines, were made, and before the hills were layd, from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102519:53"/>thou art God;</hi> arguing that he muſt needs be ſufficient: the ſame is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25.26. ſpeaking of the works of God, <hi>They ſhall periſh, and goe away like a garment, but thou art the ſame, and thy yeares never faile: that is, the ſame thou waſt, the ſame thou ſhalt be ſtill:</hi> whence it appeares plainely, that God was before any creature was made; and though it be ſaid, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.4. <hi>That God made all things for himſelf: yea the wicked, &amp;c.</hi> yet he made them without their helpe; and though he made all things for himſelfe, yet he had need of nothing; but made them that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his goodnes to them: for this is the nature of that which is good, not only to preſerve it ſelfe, but to communicate it ſelfe to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, becauſe he is the author of all the good and perfection that is in the creature: <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25. <hi>He gives life &amp; breath, and all things,</hi> that is to ſay, God gives a man his life &amp; breath, and the good things that he hath. This the Apoſtle asketh the queſtion, <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received?</hi> what hath man? If man have nothing, what creature ſhould have any thing? as for man, he received all from him, he is the father of lightes, of whom comes all good things. This is his perfection, that he is not onely ſufficient for himſelfe, but for all others; this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, for he gives all things to all creatures, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diminiſheth his owne ſtore: what good any creature hath, it hath it from him (as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith.) This argues a man hath much, when he hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for himſelfe, and to give to others. This is a proofe that God is rich, after another manner then
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102519:53"/>men are; for when men give, they have the leſſe; but when God gives, he hath nothing the leſſe: for that he gives to man, he is like to a ſpringing Fountaine, ſaith the Father, the more that you draw, the more it hath. What can you compare God to? for he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but we are glad to flye to imperfect things, to ſhew his excellency: ſo that this is the concluſion of this Reaſon, that he is ſufficient of himſelfe, becauſe ſufficient for all other things.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon is this, becauſe that good and perfection that is in the creature, was firſt in God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.17. God made man after his owne Image; the Image of God, what is it? Principally, that man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived authority over all the creatures; no, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe; this is to be made after the Image of God. Hence, it neceſſarily followes, that God had them firſt, and moſt perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe man is but the Image; therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have them ſo perfectly as the thing he repreſents: We adde further, they might be more perfect in man if God would make them ſo; but God cannot be made more perfect, becauſe he is perfection it ſelfe: adde to this, that man hath this perfection with many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; man is ſaid to be juſt, but not to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; to be loving, but not love; to be wiſe, but not wiſedome; but God is juſtice it ſelfe, love it ſelfe, and wiſedome it ſelfe: this is manifeſt, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5 <hi>God is light;</hi> he ſaith not thus, God is a thing lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that he is light without darkeneſſe; whereas man, if he have light, hath darkeneſſe alſo; but God is voide of all imperfection. Laſtly, I adde, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102519:54"/>in man are accidents, but in God they are very ſubſtance; in man and Angels they are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. An accident is that which may be added to a ſubſtance, and after be taken away from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, without deſtroying of the ſubſtance. Theſe things, wiſedome, knowledge, holineſſe, as in Angels and men are accidents they may be loſt, and leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the Angels are fallen, their juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, being qualities in them, are loſt. Againe, they may be leſſened and have degrees in men, and ſo righteouſneſſe &amp; holines are but accidents in the very Saints of God, ſo they are at one time more righteous then another; they ſometimes decay, ſometimes grow in grace, but in God they are ſubſtances; his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is himſelf, his juſtice himſelfe: look how far the Eſſence of God paſſeth the nature of man, theſe paſſe that perfection that are in men; therefore it muſt needs follow that God is moſt perfect, having all things from none, but from himſelfe, communicating to all creatures the perfections they have, and having in himſelfe their perfections more perfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe then teacheth us, that ſeeing God is ſo perfect, no man when he performeth any ſervice to God, profits God any thing; God is ſo abſolute in himſelfe that he needs nothing: If any man doth not performe this ſervice to God, doth he detract any thing from him? no, though he doth not performe it, he detracts nothing from God; for God is perfect in the higheſt degree; whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that a mans ſervice that he performes to God, is for his owne benefit, and not for any benefit to God:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102519:54"/>God never commands any worſhip for himſelfe, there cannot be any thing added to him: Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, they are deceived who thinke that in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing, God doth it either in reſpect of his owne pleaſure or profit: they are deceived, for God never commands any thing but for the profit of the doer. If you aske the ground of this, he is perfect, he is the true God, he hath no need of any mans ſervice; (as we ſaid the other day) other Lords need the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their ſervants, but God never needs it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever offer any ſervice to God, they tend to their owne profit, and if men contemne theſe things, they doe not take any thing from God, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are leſſe perfect; for herein is mans perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſerve God; and not to ſerve God, is his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>Iob</hi> 35.6, 7, 8. <hi>If thou ſinne againſt God, what is that to him? if thou doeſt righteouſly, what giveſt thou to him?</hi> there is nothing added to God: he is ſo perfect, that no ſinne can hurt him; and ſo righteous, that no righteouſneſſe can benefit him: you heard in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Oh Lord my righteouſneſſe extendeth not to thee! thou haſt no need of my righteouſneſſe. Acts</hi> 17. God hath no need of any thing.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is, We ſerve God for our owne good; we increaſe our ſelves: the Scripture cals for ſeruices only by way of juſtice, becauſe we are bound to do them: therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20. <hi>When you have done all things that you can, yet you muſt ſay that you are unprofitable ſervants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This ſhould provoke every man to labour to ſerve and pleaſe this God; becauſe he is a God
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102519:55"/>moſt perfect in himſelfe, ſufficient to inrich men with graces and gifts: this is not my uſe, but God himſelfe makes it to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>I am God al-ſufficient; what then? walke before me:</hi> there is the uſe that God hath made of it. Every man, that he may receive a bleſſing (as <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithfull did) muſt doe this, <hi>walke before God:</hi> for he will be the portion of all that walke before him: Walke before me; uſe no unlawfull meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayeſt be made rich: if thou doeſt, thou art an Infidell: God is ſufficient both in ſpirituall, and in temporall things: our nature, that it might be, muſt have God the creator, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and that we may be wiſe, we muſt have God our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and that we may be happy, we muſt have God our happineſſe: that we may have God, walke with God, and he will beſtow himſelfe upon us. Every man, if he might be his owne carver, if he might chooſe whom he would ſerve, would ſerve a King, that he might receive great gifts of him; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, There is no fiſhing to the Sea, &amp;c. Here is a King that is richer then all the Kings of the earth; for he can make all beggers Kings. Therefore labour to ſerve this King, and pleaſe this King: the ſame that he ſaid before, <hi>Walke before me, &amp;c.</hi> ſo I ſay, beleeve God is al-ſufficient, then goe on, walke on in a godly courſe; walke after God, ſtand not ſtill, looke not backward, but goe on without breaking of this courſe; it is enough that thou haſt ſuch a God that is thus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. And thinke not that thou art holy enough, and pure enough; if thou doeſt, thou art an Atheiſt.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102519:55"/>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be yee perfect, as your father in heaven is perfect:</hi> Thou muſt goe on ſtill, and never thinke thou art holy enough, &amp;c. if thou thinke ſo, thou never dideſt yet walke with thy God; and it is a queſtion, whether he be thy God or not; he may be thy God as creator, but not as redeemer: every man therefore muſt labour to proceed in godlineſſe, that is, walke in this way. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes of that ſpeech of <hi>Pauls, Philip.</hi> 3.12, 13. marke how he preſſeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it: he was a man (ſaith he) ful of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and he had a long time walked with God, yet he ſaith, <hi>I doe not count as though I had attained to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but I preſſe hard towards the marke, and ſtretch my ſelfe, ſo that I forget that which I was before.</hi> This is that which all men ought to do (for the more grace any man hath, the more weakeneſſe he feeles in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:) and therefore let every one affect this courſe. It is not ſufficient that a man hath begun to run well, there is danger to begin to ſit down; what if he ſhould then be ſet upon by the dart of death? was there not danger? but if a man ſit not downe, let death come upon him, he ſhall dye in peace. If death finde thee walking, thou ſhalt reſt with God, and ſhalt have all things in this life; and in the life to come, eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>

               <p>GOD hath revealed himſelfe in his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are taught, as you have heard what he is; which we reduced to this ſhort ſumme, that he is a ſpirituall Eſſence moſt perfect, diſtinguiſhed into three perſons: in the which deſcription, are many things to be conſidered: as Firſt, that he is an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Secondly, that he is but one Eſſence. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he is a ſpirituall Eſſence. Fourthly, that he is moſt perfect, all theſe belong to his Eſſence; and laſtly, that he is diſtinguiſhed into three perſons. Now the perfection of God, is in his Attributes, and is made manifeſt to us by them; and therefore in the next place, we are to ſpeake of them, and ſo I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this queſtion for orders ſake;</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherein conſiſteth the perfection of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In Attributes which God hath given unto it, to make it better knowne to us: which are either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, or proper, or elſe communicable: theſe things are commonly ſpoken of Gods Attributes,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102519:56"/>and properties, and ſaving other mens judgements I like of them, that doe diſtinguiſh between Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Properties. Attributes are thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Eſſence, and Properties to the perſons themſelves: ſo that the Attributes are to be ſpoken of, when we ſpeake of the Eſſence and Properties, when we ſpeake of the perſons: Attributes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the divine Eſſence of God, yet they are called Attributes, becauſe God hath taken them to himſelfe, to make himſelfe better knowne to us, ſo farre as we are able to conceive of his divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: now theſe Attributes are of two ſorts: either incommunicable and proper to God, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to any other: and of this ſort are his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe, eternity, immutability, and his immenſity: others there are communicable, they are not indeed in the ſame meaſure in us, as they are in God; for that they cannot be, but they are the like: therefore we ſay, that they are communicable, of which we will ſpeake when we come unto them: and ſo much ſhall ſerve for the firſt queſtion. Now the next queſtion which is the point to be ſtood upon, is, concerning the Simpleneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Simpleneſſe of this Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is an incommunicable Attribute, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is conceived to be without all compoſition: this muſt be confirmed, and this place which I have read, will prove it; the Lord, the Lord, &amp;c. wherein it is manifeſt that he is Jehovah of himſelfe, and by himſelfe; and though there be many things that we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102519:57"/>take to be in him, yet there is nothing in him, but himſelfe: in him there is no compoſition, therefore theſe Attributes that are given to God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are given in the abſtract, to ſhew the ſimple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his nature: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the world.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5. <hi>God is light:</hi> not a thing enlightened: <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.16. What doth this intimate? but that all theſe are his Eſſence, without compoſition: every thing that is loving is compounded, but that which is love it ſelfe, is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he is ſo ſimple that he hath no compoſition; no not ſo much as of accidents: and this is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place we have ſet downe: the Lord, the Lord, &amp;c. then he addes his Attributes, ſtrong, mercifull, and gratious, and thathe is ſuch, it is cleare, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22. <hi>I, even I, forgive thy ſinnes for my ſelfe:</hi> the Lord when he forgives ſinnes, he forgives not ſinne for the merit of man, but for his mercies ſake, and to ſhew that mercy and goodneſſe, is not in him as it is in man, therefore he ſaith, <hi>for my ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What grounds eſtabliſh this truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, Firſt, he is moſt perfect. Secondly, he is truely eternall. Thirdly, he is not ſubject to any accident or quality. To explane theſe, I ſay he is moſt perfect, then moſt ſimple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe every thing, the more perfect it is, the more ſimple; for compoſition detracts from perfection; we manifeſt it thus: In mettalls, the more ſimple, the more perfect; therefore Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doe uſe their art, to ſeparate the droſſe, to make the mettall purer; the purer it is from other mettalls,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102519:57"/>the more perfect: ſo all liquid matters, as in wine, the more perfect, the more free from lees: ſo for the Elements, the pureſt water is in the bottom of the ſea; becauſe we have not perfect things to reſemble God by, we uſe imperfect; this ſhewes us, that God is of a ſimple nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe he is truly eternall, and therefore free from any compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we ſay, truly eternall, for God is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, without ending, therefore he muſt needs be without compoſition; for if there be compoſition in God, two things are required; a compound, and ſimples, whereof he may be compounded, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two can be in reference to God, for God is eternall: if another ſhould make the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, God ſhould not be before all things. If he ſhould compound himſelfe, he ſhould be before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and as there was no compounder, ſo for the ſame reaſon, there was no ſimple to be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; becauſe that God gives being to every ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.10. <hi>I was before there was any God:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs follow, that the Eſſence is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Becauſe there are no accidents fall into God, God is ſubject to no accidents, or qualities: from which if he be free, it muſt needs follow, that he is moſt ſimple: for when we affirme that God is gracious, and good, &amp;c. when we ſpeake of theſe things in God, we ſpeake of them, not as they are vertues in men, but as they are meerly his Eſſence. In man they are qualities, but in God they are his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102519:58"/>Eſſence: thoſe in man may be changed, but in God they cannot: S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaking of the love of God, breakes forth of a ſuddaine, and ſaith; Let no man think when I ſpeak of Gods love, that I mean quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in God; for when I ſay God is love, I mean no new thing, but that ſame which the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.16. <hi>God is love:</hi> now then there is a double love; there is love giving love, there is love the ſubſtance, &amp; love the quality: If it be the name of the ſubſtance, it is given to God; if the name of the quality, it is given to man: and whatſoever is ſaid of love, may be ſaid of any other Attribute, as mercy, juſtice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This teacheth us, that there is but one Eſſence; though there be three perſons: if thou aske the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why? It is becauſe the Eſſence is moſt ſimple, and without compoſition; where there is no compoſition, there is no number; therefore there cannot be many Eſſences: and again from hence it appeares, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever theſe things are attributed to God, that he is love, mercy, favour, and anger, howſoever they are ſpoken, as though they were many and different, yet in God they are but one, and the ſame. True it is, that we are of a compounded underſtanding, they are as ſeverall things to us; becauſe we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God as he is, yet by faith, we are brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that there is no ſuch difference between them in God: that which is the love of God, is the hatred of God; and that which is his wiſdome, is his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer alſo; becauſe there is but one and the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes to this purpoſe; God is ſimple, he is great, and without weight or bulke:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102519:58"/>and he is wiſe, without any wiſdome: we cannot ſay that his juſtice is one thing, and his mercy another; both theſe are his Eſſence, but we are of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded underſtanding, and cannot but diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Is God thus ſimple, that his love, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and his juſtice are his very Eſſence; we then will joine theſe two together; here then, is matter of joy, and comfort, and matter of terror and feare: firſt, matter of joy, and comfort, mercy and love, are Gods Eſſence. What is the comfort of a male factor? that he hath a mercifull Judge, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 20.31. <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Benadad ſay, we have heard that the Kings of Iſrael are mercifull Kings.</hi> So is a man in miſery; what is his comfort? he hath a compaſſionate friend, full of compaſſion, and yet theſe are but accidents in man, and may deceive: how much greater comfort then is this, that God is love it ſelfe, mercy it ſelfe, juſtice it lelfe, (with reverence may I ſpeake it;) he may ceaſe to be, before he can ceaſe to be mercifull, and good? &amp;c. This is that the Prophet uſeth to comfort the children of God with, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.8. <hi>For a moment have I hid my face from thee, but with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting compaſsions will I imbrace thee:</hi> So <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved you with an everlaſting love.</hi> Man loves, and he loves but for a time; the ſame man that loved upon a ſmall occaſion, comes to hate as extreamly, as he loved tenderly: the reaſon is, becauſe man is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but God loves more earneſtly then man can do; for it is his Eſſence, and he never changes: heer is the comfort, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a mother forget her ſon?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102519:59"/>her ſon new born, though ſome mother can be ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>yet I will not forget you:</hi> yea Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, <hi>if you being evill can give good things, how much more ſhall your heavenly father give his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to thoſe that aske him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſerves alſo for feare, and terror: why? becauſe Gods anger, his mercy, his juſtice, are his Eſſence, and he is unchangeable: <hi>The anger of a King is much to be feared, it is like the meſſenger of death: Prov.</hi> 14 7. yet the anger of a King is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, for a man of wiſedome will appeaſe it; but Gods anger when he ſets it upon any, it ſhould make him tremble; it is his Eſſence, God himſelfe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that man; theſe Attributes are his Eſſence: therefore theres no reaſon why any man ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon the mercy of God, for God is juſtice; nor deſpaire, for God is mercy: thus we have ground of comfort, and fear: there is no ſound comfort, where there is no true feare, theſe two ever goe together; true feare of his juſtice, and comfort of his mercy. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Bernard. ſex. bre. 25. Duo ſunt pedes &amp;c.</note> God hath two feete, and one of theſe two feete is feare, the other love; and with theſe two God walkes in the hearts of men; when he comes to the crevice of the heart of man, he puts in the foot of feare, and looke how much feare, ſo much comfort. If thou wilt know that God walks in thy heart in love, he firſt ſets in his left foot of feare; and therefore know thus much, thou muſt have part in theſe two: firſt, in the feare of God, and ſo in the love, and comforts of God: theſe muſt both goe together, and therefore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102519:59"/>get thy heart ſmitten with the feare of God, or elſe thou art but a vaine man, to preſume of comfort: and thus much forthe ſimpleneſſe of Gods divine Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, the Eternity of God: and the queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the eternity of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, it is an incommunicable attribute, whereby the divine Eſſence is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or ending, and without ſucceſſion: the parts of this we will explane: firſt, it is ſaid to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Attribute, becauſe it is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to none, but proper to God. Secondly, that it is without beginning, or ending; all this appeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath this name of eternity given to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Abraham</hi> made an Altar, and offered to the <hi>God of eternity. Pſal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>From everlasting to everlaſting, thou art God. Iſai</hi> 44.6. <hi>I am the Lord, and before me there was no God, neither ſhall there be after me. Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The inviſible things of God,</hi> as his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power, and god-head, <hi>are ſeene.</hi> To what tends all this? but to tell us, that he had no beginning, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ending. Thirdly, the third thing is, that he is without ſucceſſion; that is, hath neither firſt, nor latter; neither preſent, nor to come. There can be no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion without time, there is no ſucceſſion with God; for, <hi>a thouſand yeeres with God, are but as one day,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. ſo that with man there are ſucceſſions, but with God there are no ſucceſſions; for all things are naked, and bare before him: ſo the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal</hi> 2. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eternall begetting of the ſame (ſaith,) <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:102519:60"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What grounds have you for this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is: firſt, becauſe he is the true Jehovah; that is, hath his being of himſelfe, &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he is the creator of all things, and of time it ſelfe. Thirdly, He is the author and giver of eternall life, to thoſe that have it. To explane theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, He is Jehovah: ſo we have heard the word explaned: a God that hath his being of himſelfe, and not receiving it from any other: for if he have his being from any, he muſt receive it from himſelfe, or from ſome other: receive it from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he could not; for nothing can be the efficient cauſe of it ſelfe: againe, he could not receive it from any other, becauſe that all other have their being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and from him: he is the firſt and the laſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.8, 10. If the firſt, then none before him: then he received it not of any other: ſo that this is true which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes, This eternall, can ſpeake to the heart of man; <hi>I am, that I am:</hi> and it can onely be ſaid of him, that he is, <hi>I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The next Reaſon is, Becauſe he is the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of all things; even of time it ſelfe: and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was before time, muſt be eternall. If God made time, he muſt needes be before time; and therefore he muſt needes be eternall: for whatſoever is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time, is temporall, and momentary. I cannot ſee (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>) that there ſhould be ſpace of time in eternity: why? becauſe ſpace of time is made by the motion of things paſt, and to come: I cannot ſee any ſuch thing in eternity; for there nothing is paſt:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102519:60"/>for then, that which is, ſhould ceaſe to be: nothing to come; for then that ſhould have beene alwayes, which yet is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The third Reaſon is, Becauſe he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and giver of eternall life, to thoſe that have it. Thence it appeares, that he muſt needes be eternall himſelfe; for whatſoever can give eternity, that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: there is an eternity that hath a beginning, and ſo the Angels, and ſoules of men are eternall; but that is ſuch an eternity, as differs from the eternity of God: all Angels, and the ſoules of men, though eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, are in themſelves corruptible, and capable of an end; but by the power and goodneſſe of God, they are kept ſtill: the ſoules of the wicked to torment, and the ſoules of the godly, to eternall life. The good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to glory, and the apoſtate angels to hell fire: and thus we have made the point cleare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The Uſes then are theſe: firſt, here is incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in life and death. It incourageth to goe on in a pious courſe, and though we meet with black tongues, although we meet with ſcoffes, though we beare the markes of the Lord Jeſus, yet let us goe on ſtill: here is our comfort, God lives for ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and recompence us, for that which we ſhall ſuffer: therefore this ſerves to encourage us to goe through reproach, and evill ſpeeches; becauſe God lives for euer: there is no greater incouragement for a ſouldier that is in the field, to make him fight, then the hope of reward, and that he hath a rich Generall, that will reward him; yet he hath this diſcouragement, it may be the Generall may dye in the battaile, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102519:61"/>then, who ſhall reward him, for that he hath done? and ſo, according to the proverbe, that which is done for old men and children, is all loſt: becauſe old men dye, and children forget: ſo we may ſay, whatſoever is done for man, is loſt: But this King lives for ever; whoſoever thou be, goe on in the ſervice of God, and thou ſhalt have plenteous reward, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb</hi> 10. God is faithfull, and he will not forget your worke, and labour of love: ſo we may make it our uſe, he will not forget the blaſphemies, and ſcoffes that men undergoe in his ſervice: thus ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> he that rejoyceth in his ſoule now, ſhall one day be ſorrowfull; becauſe that God is eternall: he that rejoyceth in worldly things, the time will come that he will ſorrow; on the other ſide, the children of God which joy in God, ſhall rejoyce, when the world ſhall weepe: will a man have a laſting joy? cleave firſt to the eternall God; goe on in a good courſe, be not diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The laſt Uſe of this Attribute of God, that he is eternall: that as he is the firſt, ſo he is the laſt: ſo the Scripture deſcribes him: then here is matter of diſcouragement to the wicked, becauſe they are they that contemne God, and contemne his word; they are they that account the proud happy; they are they that ſcorne the yoke of Chriſt; they are they that ſcoffe at thoſe that ſubmit themſelves to God: there is terrour for them: have they proſperity? have they honours? have they bags full? when all theſe part, and they goe out of the world, then God lives to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence them: for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>Let
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102519:61"/>thoſe mine enemies, that would not have me to rule over them, be bound hand and foot.</hi> This may cut the combs of all ſuch as ſcorne at, and diſgrace Gods people: Oh that you could alwayes thinke of this eternity of God! he lives for ever. Remember this when you are ſicke, and when you are well: oh! then what goodly promiſes have the Miniſters from you? how carefully you will walke before God? but you, like Atheiſts, thinke, God is mortall, like your ſelves: it is undeniable, that you think thus; for if Atheiſme had not poſſeſt your hearts, this would have awakened you: oh that this would be thought upon! oh the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and toyes that your hearts are poſſeſt withall! Alas! you muſt give an account to God, for every penny gotten: oh that this were written in your harts! Finally, then this is matter of comfort to the godly; when a good man comes to dye, that hath walked with God 10.20. or 30. yeeres, and yet is loath to depart from his wife, and children, and friends; he ſhould ſtirre up his heart, to be willing; for he goes to that God that lives for ever; and therefore he ſhould not feare to goe to him. As a Father reports of an old Chriſtian, when he was to dye, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unwilling, he ſaith to himſelfe; Why art thou afraid to goe to him, whom thou haſt laboured to ſerve 70. yeeres? then this ſhall be the reward of the godly mans well doing in this life; in the life to come, he ſhall goe to God, that lives for ever: this may comfort him, that he hath a God, that will give him a plentifull reward, glory, and happineſſe hereafter.</p>

               <p>THE perfection of God, as you have heard, is made knowne to us by his Attributes: and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes be of two ſorts; either communicable, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, ſuch as cannot be aſcribed to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and of the firſt ſort of theſe, you heard the laſt day. In the next place, we are to handle two more; and theſe are, his immutability, and his infiniteneſſe: and now concerning the firſt of theſe, the Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of God: according to our order; the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Immutability of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is an incommunicable Attribute, whereby he is void of all corruption, and alteration. This attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is given to God divers wayes: there is an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his nature, and there is an unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his courſe, and of his will: but we will not here ſpeake of any other immutability, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſſe of his nature; for the immutability of his Counſell, and his Will, will fall in their place
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102519:62"/>to be ſpoken of. I ſay this is an incommunicable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, becauſe it is not common, neither can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to any other, but God: for though there are things that are immutable, yet they are ſubject of themſelves to alteration: the ſoules of men are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of themſelves to alteration, through the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their creation; but they are kept by God, if he would, he might leave them, and then they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>This Immutability, not to be ſubject to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is properly attributed to the divine Eſſence: that it is ſo, is manifeſt in this place I have read, <hi>Hee onely hath immortality,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.17. he cals him the King immortall: the ſame is in <hi>Pſal</hi> 102.26, 27. <hi>They ſhall change,</hi> ſpeaking of the heavens and the earth, <hi>but thou ſhalt endure: thy yeeres never faile:</hi> ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12. And this ſhall ſuffiſe for this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>For what cauſe is the divine Eſſence free from corruption and alteration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, Becauſe the power of it is ſo great, that it cannot be corrupted, by any power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Secondly, becauſe it is without quantity, and cannot be leſſe or greater. Thirdly, becauſe it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quality, and cannot be better or worſe: nor in any other condition: we will manifeſt theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning Gods power: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.26. <hi>My Father that gave them me is greater then all and no man is able to pull them out of his hand:</hi> why? becauſe there is no power greater then himſelfe: And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102519:63"/>this is the nature of every thing, to preſerve it ſelfe: If any thing had power enough, it would not be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; we apply this to God that hath all power; none can corrupt him: our Saviour Chriſt alledgeth, that place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. to ſhew that his ſheepe can never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: why? becauſe my father that gave them me, is greater then all: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> uſeth theſe words, If any of theſe ſheepe periſh, (ſpeaking of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God) God is overcome by the faculty of man, or ſome power that comes from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, againe, God is without quantity: and therefore can be neither leſſer nor greater, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith; he is great without quantity: and wher there is no quantity, there can be no diminution, for God cannot be leſſer or greater: he cannot be greater, for then he ſhould not be infinite; and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be leſſer, for then he ſhould ceaſe to be infinite; and therfore he cannot be leſſer or greater, ſo is voyd of all alteration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, againe, he cannot be better, or worſe; why? he cannot be beter, for then he ſhould not be perfect; he cannot be worſe, for then he ſhould ceaſe to be perfect; neither can he be in a leſſe good eſtate, for if he be, then he loſeth the good he had, and takes the ill he had not: if he loſe the good he had, then hee wants, and ſo ſtill ſhould be imperfect, and therefore hee is thus without quality, &amp;c. ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. This confirmes us, that we ſerve the true God, and not the falſe Gods of theſe nations; becauſe we ſerve the Immortall, and the Immutable God:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102519:63"/>they ſerve falſe Gods, becauſe their Gods are muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; how appeares this? thus, becauſe their Poets which were their prophets, tell us, they were Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, &amp;c. and the Apoſtle ſaith they were ſubject to ſinne; becauſe for ſinne, death went over all fleſh; therefore they are falſe Gods, and they ſerve falſe Gods: Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaking of celeſtiall creatures, ſayth, they are ſubject to ſinne; for the Angels, ſome of them ſinned and became divels: and ſome of them did not ſinne, not becauſe they were not able to ſinne; but for that God aſſiſted them, that they ſinned not; they alſo were ſubject to ſinne, and ſo to death after their kind; for there is none free, no not the Angels by their nature, but as they are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Chriſt: So that we ſee the Gods of the nations are falſe Gods, and as they ſay they are Gods of the mountaines, and not of the valleis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2. The ſecond vſe is, to eſtabliſh the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our faith; becauſe God is immutable: we truſt not to mutable man, wee make not fleſh our Arme, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils; but we truſt upon him that is immutable: Heere is the certainty of our faith; our ſtrength reſts not in us, but in him, on whom it is built: and it is with us, as it is with children, who have but a weake hand and arme, notwithſtanding, if they be helped by their father who is a ſtrong man, they can performe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: wherein is the childs ſtrength? it is plaine it is not in the childe, but in the father; ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> man holds not God, but God him: And this is the comfort that we have, when we feele our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102519:64"/>faith weake, we are kept by the power of God unto ſalvation; Therefore this Attribute ſheweth, that our faith being ſo kept can never faile. I doe not doubt, (for the Diſciples began to doubt, we hoped that this man ſhould have redeemed Iſrael,) but it cannot faile; for it muſt needes be certaine becauſe grounded, and built upon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 3. The third uſe is matter of comfort, to all thoſe that are Gods children, and ſo in the love of God: what is their comfort? their King that loveth them is immortall: they have not the favour of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall King, but of an immortall King; how great is that worldly honour, that earthly joy, and that temporall reſt, that many men have in the favour of Princes? and yet notwithſtanding, what are theſe Princes? even mortall, ſuch as muſt moſt certainely die, and none can tell how ſoone; this therfore is a vaine thing to truſt to; for we ſee in what a trice, <hi>Nebuchadonozer</hi> was taken away, and <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> his ſonne, even in a moment; all their honour was taken away and layd in the duſt: yea and more then this, they that have the favour of earthly Princes abuſe it and grow proud and inſolent of their inferiors; who as ſoon (or before) as the Kings bones be cold, labor to pluck them down from their excellency: as <hi>Bathſheba</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.21. <hi>When thou my Lord ſhalt be gathered to thy fathers, I and Solomon ſhall be reputed offenders;</hi> So they may ſay, when the king ſhall be gathered to his fathers, they ſhall be counted vile; ſo that this is a comfortleſſe comfort, to depend upon a mortall man; but here is the comfort and happineſſe of thoſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102519:64"/>that have the favour and countenance of God; they depend upon the favour of an immortall King that never dies, but ever lives, and will preſerve all thoſe that are his: they need not feare any earthly power, if they have confidence in Chriſt; they need not feare, if their owne corruptions doe not provoke God: ſo then we ſee here is matter of comfort to Gods people, they have the love of an immortall king that lives for ever, and loves for ever, and will be their God, and the God of their ſeeed: Therefore parents if they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make their children great, let them not have that exceſſive care to get riches for them, but labour to make them religious, that God may care for them: that ſame that <hi>Barzillat</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.37. <hi>When David would have had him to go over with him; no ſaith he take my Sonne;</hi> and we ſee <hi>David</hi> gave <hi>Solomon</hi> charge of him when he was a dying; here is the comfort of good children, when their parents feare God: God lives for ever to helpe and bleſſe them, though their parents be dead; but where the parents will exceſſivelv care for them, God leaves them: how many doe we ſee come to poverty that have had thouſands left them? how comes this to paſſe? God hath with-drawne his bleſſing and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from them: their parents tooke care to gather, and heape up, but not to ſowe religion in their hearts, and intreſt them in God. Brethren if you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow halfe the time in labouring to make your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren religious, that you ſpend to make them great, and rich, Gods favourable providence would be greatly ſeene towards them; but for want of this, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102519:65"/>ſame riches that perchance carrie the father to hell in getting them, may bring the ſonne after him in ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them: thus then we ſee, to Gods people it is a marvailous comfort that we have a God that lives for ever; that will take care for us, and our poſterity; and thus much for this Immutability of God.</p>
               <p>To come to the next thing, his infinitenes; and to avoid all deſcriptions, defining infinitenes, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſhewing how many wayes God is infinite: and to keepe our ſelves to this place: It affoords only the Infinitenes of place, and this is the thing that we are now to ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Infinitenes, and the Immenſity of the Divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is an incommunicable property, wherby it is preſentin all places in the world, and out of the world, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tone time; to explane this.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay, it is an incommunicable Attribute, becauſe it cannot be attributed to any other; for though ſome creatures are not to be limited by external bounds; yet there is no creature but may be limited by his nature; and thus Angels, and ſpirits, that are not to be limited by externall bounds, yet by the bounds of their own nature they may; and though they have not ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall bodies, externall, yet they are limited in themſelves internally; but God is ſo infinite that he is not limited externally or internally, and this is ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper to God, that he ſhould be in all places in a moment, and not divided in any place, but the whole Eſſence is every where; we doe not ſay part of the Eſſence: as if a man were ſo great that his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102519:65"/>head were in England, his leggs in Spaine, his armes in France; but the whole is not in every place. I doe not ſay ſo, but our God is never divided, he is never parted, but his whole Eſſence is every where. We explane this, by the ſimilitude of the ſoule; the whole is in every part of the body; there is not ſome in the foote, ſome in the head, and ſome in the hand, but the whole is in every parte; thus have I explaned this queſtion: I now come to prove it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>Whither ſhall I goe from thy preſence? if I aſcend up to heaven, thou art there: If to the utmoſt part of the earth, thou art there:</hi> There is no place to which we can goe from God; for he is in every place, and excluded out of no place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.1. <hi>Heaven is my throne, and earth is my foote ſloole:</hi> (St. <hi>Hilar. de trin lib.</hi> 1.) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Prophet ſo ſpeakes, to ſhew that the Lord fills heaven and earth. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.24. explanes it, <hi>I fill heaven, and earth;</hi> and more then this, he is neere to every one: <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27. This ſhewes, that God is within the world, and without the world; that apeares in, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. <hi>The heaven of heavens are not able to containe thee; how much leſſe the houſe that I have built?</hi> and thus the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12. <hi>He hath the ſea in his fiſt, and hath meaſured the heavens with his Spann; where is be that ſhuts up the duſt of the earth in a void place, and hath weyed the mountaines?</hi> therefore it is manifeſt that he is in all places, both within and without the world.</p>
               <p>The next queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is he ſo infinite, in every place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe he is ſimple, neither
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102519:66"/>having nor poſſible to have parts; ſecondly, becauſe the power of the Divine Eſſence is every where: thirdly, becauſe there is but one Eſſence in three perſons of the Diety, common to them all; To explane theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, that the Divine Eſſence is moſt ſimple, I explaned it the laſt day. The next, that, it is without parts, it followes, if it have no parts, it is whole; and this is the reaſon that Philoſophers, and antient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have given, that the ſoule ſhould be whole in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, becauſe it is moſt ſimple, and hath no parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, becauſe the power of the divine Eſſence is every where, for nothing is in God, but his Eſſence; if therfore the power of God be every where, then it muſt needs followe that God is every where; It is manifeſt, that his power is in the creating of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, we will not now ſtand to prove it: therefore he being the only maker of all things, ſhall neceſſarily be in them: but God doth not only make all things, but ſu ſtaineth all things made, and therefore he muſt needs be every where: this is manifeſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>the Spirit moved upon the waters;</hi> that is, for the ſuſtaining and the upholding of them by his power: what power but his Eſſencial? As a hen hatches her egges by ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over them, ſo doth the holy Ghoſt ſuſtaine all things, by mooving upon them; and therefore his Eſſenciall preſence muſt be every where: This the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>he is neere to every one of us: in him, we live, move, and have our being;</hi> ſo that by this, it appeares, that God is infinite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, becauſe there is but one Eſſence
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102519:66"/>of the three perſons in the deietie: that is common to them all, and is in ſeverall, and diſtinct places, at one, and the ſame time, then it muſt followe that it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: for firſt, the Eſſence is not divided, part in the Father, part in the Sonne, part in the holy Ghoſt; but is intire in each perſon, as hath bin proved: Secondly, theſe three are in ſeverall places, not at ſeverall times, as a finite thing may be, but at the ſame time, which nothing can be that is not infinite: This appeares; the Father is ſaid to be in heaven, who is the ſame Eſſence with the Sonne, who was ſomtimes on earth and dwelt amongſt us: the Sonne at the ſame time was in heaven, when he was upon the earth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. Heaven and earth are diſtinct places, therefore it muſt needs follow, that the ſame Eſſence being in them both at the ſame time, is infinite: the ſcripture maketh this more plaine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.32. <hi>I am not alone, but the Father is alway with me;</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.11. <hi>I am in the Father, and the Father in me;</hi> How is this mutuall immeation made? they have both the ſame Eſſence; therefore the perſons though diſtinguiſhed yet cannot bee ſeparated, as ſhall afterwards be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt is the ſame Eſſence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſame is in the hearts of all the faithfull, wherſoever they be, and how farre diſtant one from another; for they are the temple of the holy Ghoſt: who dwels in them not only by his grace, but by his Eſſence; therefore this Eſſence is infinite. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> proves the deity of the holy Ghoſt by this infinitenes of his Eſſence: who dares ſay, (ſaith he) that the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102519:67"/>holy Ghoſt is a creature, when he is not limited? ſo then we ſee by theſe reaſons that God is infinite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. The firſt uſe then ſerves to confute the doctine of Popery, and the ubiquitaries that hold, that the body of Chriſt is in all, or in many places at the ſame time, which cannot be ſo; my reaſon is, becauſe that Chriſts body, is a finite creature, and though it be glorified, yet it is not deified; and it is an incommunicable attribute of the deity, to be in many places at one and the ſame time: Chriſt his body though it be glorified, yet it remaines a body ſtill; and therefore contrary to theſe opinions, can bee but in one place at one time; for to bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed in a place, is an inſeparable property of a body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe is for our inſtruction. Is God in every place by his Eſſence? certainely, if this were knowne, and beleeved, it would be a ſpeciall meanes to reſtraine men from evill; for they would know that whatſoever they doe, they doe it before the face of God: be they never ſo ſecret, there is no place from which God is excluded, but in every place is that God, who is of more pure eyes then to behold ſinne, and can abide to looke upon any wickedneſſe: therefore whereſoever a man is, this ſhould make him afraid to ſinne againſt God, whatſoever his place be, or whatſoever his wealth bee, yet this ſhould reſtraine him: This ſhould not only reſtraine men from eternall ſinning, but even from the inward evill thoughts of the heart; for God is in every place, and ever preſent in the heart; this preſence of God being
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102519:67"/>rightly conſidered, is like a grave Matron coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wanton maides; as when ſhe comes all is quiet: ſo this will ſet the heart free from that coveteouſnes, pride, that hatred which is ordinary in it. Againe, if God dwell in us, and if we be deſirous to have God to delight to dwell in us, let us delight in good duties, and labour to be the ſame inwardly, that we ſeeme to be outwardly; for God takes notice of our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as he takes notice of our outward actions; God is in every place, therfore this ſhould make every man labour inward purity and holineſſe. Indeed man may forbeare the act of ſinne for outward, and carnall reſpects: but to have a pure heart, becauſe God is preſent, this is to be like him that loves truth in the inward parts: God delights in him that trembles at his word; therefore labour that God may delight in thee; labor to be good in ſecret places where no body ſees, for God is preſent in ſecret, to reward openly: To conclude this point; It is much to be lamented, that many men know not this doctrine of Gods om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſency, that more beleeve it not; for if they did, it could not be, that they ſhould live ſo ungodly as they doe: certainely, the men of this age are meere infidels; it appeares in this, when they come into the Church, the houſe of God, and the place where they apprehend him preſent, what holineſſe and reverence doe they make a ſhew of? when they depart from thence, they leave their holyneſſe with the place: A great fault which <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus pedagog. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>ſub finem.</hi> complained of in the Chriſtians of his time: whereas if they did know, and believe that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102519:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>God fils every place, even their ſecret cogitations, what maner of men would they alwaies be? we think that God doth not ſee us, but God doth ſee us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us walke in the ſight of God, and we ſhall keepe our ſelves from many corruptions.</p>

               <p>IN the nature of God, we conſidered his greatneſſe, and his goodneſſe: his greatneſſe is diſcerned by his incommunicable attributes; which are, ſimple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, eternity, immutability, and immenſity: of which we have ſpoken. His goodneſſe is beſt diſcovered by his communicable Attributes, of which we now come to ſpeake: about which, obſerve, that we doe not call them communicable Attributes, as if they were communicated ſo to the creature, as they are in the creator; but becauſe there is in mans nature ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in proportion, or in effect, like to theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies that are in God: In man, wiſedome, juſtice, mercy, &amp;c. are accidents; in God, not ſo, but are his Eſſence: theſe things are truely ſaid of man in the concrete; that he is wiſe, juſt, mercifull, &amp;c. but of God in the abſtract, that he is wiſedome, juſtice, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: in man, theſe things are different, juſtice is not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102519:68"/>mercy, mercy is not wiſedome, &amp;c. but in God they are all the ſame; his moſt ſimple Eſſence being his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, wiſdome, mercy, &amp;c. In man, they have a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of imperfection; but in God, they are perfect: thoſe Attributes which are incommunicable, running alſo through theſe, and ſo as it were, making theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo incommunicable: to explane it, God is good, and the creature good, but God is ſimply, eternally, immutably, infinitely good, and therefore goodneſſe is Gods alone; as our Saviour, <hi>there is none good but God:</hi> in which reſpect alſo, the Apoſtle cals him onely wiſe, becauſe onely ſimple, eternally immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, infinitely wiſe. In a word, God takes theſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to himſelfe; not becauſe theſe doe fully and perfectly expreſſe what he is, but becauſe our ſhallow and weake underſtandings cannot aſcend higher, in conceiving the nature of God, then theſe perfections doe reveale him: of theſe we ſpeak in order: and firſt of the life of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the life of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, it is a communicable attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, whereby we conceive that God lives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, acting and moving of himſelfe. To open this? firſt, it is a communicable attribute, not that life is in man, as it is in God, but that there is in man ſomewhat that is like to this life in God: man hath life, and the man and his life are two things; but in God, his life, and his Eſſence are all one: and there is nothing in God but his life. This is that which acts and moves of it ſelfe, without receiving any thing from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is that which lives eternally, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102519:69"/>or ending: this appears by thoſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that call him <hi>the living God, Deut.</hi> 5.28. <hi>My ſoule thirſteth for God, even for the living God, Pſal.</hi> 42.2. and other teſtimonies, where God ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>that he lives, Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord:</hi> ſo by theſe formes of oathes that they uſed, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8.24. <hi>As the Lord liveth:</hi> So <hi>Ruth.</hi> 3.3. <hi>As the Lord liveth:</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting this to God himſelfe. Hereupon it is ſaid, that he is life, <hi>I am life,</hi> and therefore he cals him life, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10. <hi>the true God, and eternall life:</hi> this life is eternall, and hath no beginning, nor ending: ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46. <hi>I live for ever:</hi> I have a perpetuall life without change: and ſo he is called the fountaine of life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is this life attributed to this divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he underſtands, wils, and workes of his owne power. Secondly, becauſe he hath life in himſelfe, without any manner of participation from any other. Thirdly, becauſe God gives life to all other living things: whether life of nature, life of grace, or life of glory. To explane this; he is life, becauſe he underſtandeth, willeth, and worketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. All theſe be actions, which none can do, but ſuch as have life; therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, if theſe be in God, then life is in him. If any ſhould be ſo ſenceleſſe, as to deny theſe things in God, he muſt be a Pagan rather then a Chriſtian: therefore as <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaith, If I be to ſpeake to Pagans that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe things, I contemne to prove them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot, but becauſe they are ſo ſottiſh. So I
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102519:69"/>ſay, if there be any that deny this, I contemne to prove it, not becauſe I cannot for want of proofes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am in no hope to doe them any good. Theſe three things, are three diſtinct things in man; the ſoule, the motion, and life: the ſoule is one thing, the motion another, and the life another; whereupon theſe are three in man, but in God his Eſſence is all one, by which he willeth, worketh, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: therefore it muſt needes be that God is life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, becauſe he lives of himſelfe, without any participation from others: therefore is life truely attributed to God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.26. <hi>The Father hath life in himſelfe, and hath given to the ſonne to have life in himſelfe:</hi> therefore he is ſaid to be the fountain of life, ecauſe as the fountaine receives not water from any other, but conveys it to others; ſo, neither doth God receive life from any, but doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to all things that live: ſo then, God hath life in himſelfe, whoſoever ſhall ſeperate life from him, ſhall ſeperate him from himſelf, and deſtroy God: therefore ſeeing that God lives without participating life from any other, it muſt needs follow, that life is truely given to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The third reaſon is, becauſe they that have life, whether the life of grace, the life of nature, or the life of glory, have it of God. The Scripture ſpeakes of all theſe three lives. The life of nature is common to all living things, trees, beaſts, men live: but not to ſpeake of life but as it is in men; men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their naturall life from God; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>God breathed in man the breath of life, and man became a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102519:70"/>living ſoule, Gen.</hi> 2.7. The life of grace is called in Scripture, the life of God; <hi>they were alienated from the life of God, Ephe.</hi> 4. that is, they had not that life, that God gives to thoſe that are his: God gives a naturall life to all; but not the life of grace, which, becauſe it comes from God, and leades to God, is called the life of God; he alſo gives the life of glory, to thoſe that by continuance in well doing, ſeek glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, immortality,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.7.</note> eternall life: &amp;c. ſo that ſeeing God is the author, and giver of theſe lives, it is plaine that life is truly attributed to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This teacheth us, that certainly, we ſerve the onely true God, becauſe we ſerve the living God: for the true God, is the living God, that hath life in himſelf, &amp; of himſelf: the Gods of the Nations are falſe gods; the heathen worſhip the hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſtocks, and ſtones, ſilver, and gold, the workes of mens hands, that have no life, or if they had life, they have no ſuch life, as is in the true God, which hath his life in himſelfe, and of himſelfe: we may ſay of their gods, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> prophanely ſcoffed at <hi>Conſtantines</hi> god, that he worſhipt ſuch a god, as no man could tell from whence he came; their gods are made with mens hands, and have no life in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, this ſhewes the heinouſneſſe of that ſinne which is uſually committed among men, who when they ſpeake earneſtly, ſay as the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, which is an aſſeveration, a kinde of an oath; and though men thinke they doe not ſinne, yet they doe abuſe an oath, and a greater oath, then if they did ſweare by God himſelfe: an oath ought to be taken
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102519:70"/>with feare and reverence, in truth, righteouſneſſe, and judgement; and not to be abuſed, as <hi>Salvian</hi> obſerves in his time: as if they were not oathes to binde men, but as meere complements of ſpeech; they who are now ſo bold to ſay, the Lord liveth, ſwearing falſely or prophanely, ſhall one day finde, and feele, that the Lord liveth to take vengeance of perjury and prophaneneſſe; and that it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This teacheth us, how we may have life and length of daies; it muſt be by ſerving, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and cleaving to God, the author and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, this is the way to obtaine life; it is not my uſe, but the uſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> makes; <hi>Deuter.</hi> 30.19.20. <hi>I have ſet before ye this day, life, and death; chuſe life:</hi> how? <hi>by ſerving and obeying, and cleaving to the Lord, for be is thy life:</hi> Where he ſhewes, that a man may have life, and length of daies; There is nothing that man deſires more then life, and length of dayes; and therefore the divell, that could not prevaile with <hi>Iob</hi> in other things, yet for his life, he thought he ſhould: There is no way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this much deſired long life, but this, to cleave to God, the fountaine, and giver of life. This is the courſe in which, God himſelfe directed <hi>Solomon;</hi> if thou wilt walke in my waies to keep my ſtatutes, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, then I will lengthen thy dayes: This is the argument which <hi>Hezechiah</hi> uſed, and by which he prevailed, not only reverſed the ſentence of death, but obtained a leaſe of life, for fifteene years; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, oh Lord! how I have walked before thee in truth,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102519:71"/>and with a perfect heart: it was not the ſtrength of conſtitution, but the ſincerity of ſpirit, that prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the life, and vigor of <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Ioſua,</hi> for forty yeares: How ſhould this conſideration lift up our hearts in the waies of God? <hi>What man is he,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 34-12. <hi>that deſireth life, and loveth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies, that he may ſee good?</hi> nay, rather, what man is he that doth not? Every man deſireth life, and proſperity; then heare <hi>Davids</hi> direction; <hi>Keep thy tongue from evill, and thy lips from ſpeaking guile, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from evill, and doe good, ſeeke peace, and purſue it.</hi> This is the way to obtaine them: In humility, and the feare of the Lord, are riches, and honour, and life. It is true, ſome wicked men live long; but no wicked man can promiſe himſelfe long life, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. <hi>The bloudy and deceitfull man, ſhall not live out halfe his daies.</hi> It is true, ſome good men die in their youth, but not till they are glutted with life; <hi>The child ſhall die an hundred yeares old, Iſa.</hi> 65.20. that is, as well ſatisfied with life, as if he had lived an hundred yeares: Thus, to feare God, is the way to live long in the earth; nay it is the way never to die: <hi>Eternall life is promiſed, to thoſe who with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence continue in well doing.</hi> To conclude, God is life, God is the Fountaine of life; unto him, we muſt ſeek for the continuance of the life of nature, the inchoati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preſervation of the life of grace, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the life of glory.</p>
               <p>The next Attribute that is communicable, is the wiſdome of God, and ſo according to our order, the queſtion is:</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:102519:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the wiſdome of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, that it is that, by which God knowes, and underſtands himſelfe, and all things elſe; not ſucceſſively, nor by diſcourſe, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, but in a moment, by one eternall act of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: this needs a little explaning; and Firſt, that it is a communicable Attribute, becauſe there is the like in man, though not the ſame. 2. By which he underſtands and knowes himſelfe; and not himſelfe only, but all things elſe, with the cauſes, circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and whatſoever elſe thereto belongeth: how? Not ſucceſſively, and by diſcourſe and reaſoning; for though they be diſtinct one from another, and come one after another, yet he in a moment under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands them all by one act of underſtanding. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howſoever the Scripture tells us of three things in God, that there is preſence, ſcience, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, yet they are all one in God: for God, to ſpeake properly, hath neither preſence, nor remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, for he knowes all things by one eternall act of underſtanding; he admits no ſucceſſion, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in reſpect of us, God doth foreknow, yet in God there is nothing but ſcience, for by one act of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he knowes all things: and that it is ſo, that he underſtands himſelfe, is manifeſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>No man knoweth the Father but the ſon; no man hath ſeen the Father: Iohn</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man knowes the things of God, but the ſpirit of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. In which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though Chriſt and the Apoſtle expreſſe the Sonne, or holy Ghoſt, yet they exclude not the Father, but intimate him, teaching <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102519:72"/>this knowledge is in them all, as he knowes himſelfe, ſo alſo all things elſe: The wiſedome of God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; if it be infinite, then is nothing to be excluded from it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. Every thing is manifeſt before him, with whom we have to doe: He knowes things paſt, preſent, and to come, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evill and the good;</hi> he knowes all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. He knew the wickedneſſe of mans heart was great: So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.4. <hi>Thou ſeeſt my thoughts a farre off; there is not a word in my mouth but thou knoweſt it.</hi> Whither ſhall I goe from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the night and the day are all one? Againe, he knowes all things without ſucceſſion of time; as well that which is preſent, as that which is to come: Therefore ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 90.4. <hi>a thouſand yeares are with the Lord, but as yeſterday, when it is paſt.</hi> Whatſoever is to be done with the Lord a thouſand yeares after, is as preſent with him, or as a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares is but as one day:</hi> So that we ſee, God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands all things paſt, preſent, and to come.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is this wiſedome Attributed to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe this wiſedome is this Eſſence it ſelfe. Secondly, becauſe he is the Creator, and governor of all things. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is infinite both in time and place; theſe things opened will manifeſt that he hath this infinite wiſedome.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, this wiſedome of God is his Eſſence it ſelfe; as his will, his holineſſe, his juſtice, his mercy
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102519:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>are himſelfe; ſo alſo the wiſedome of God is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. You heard the rule, becauſe he is moſt ſimple, and therefore of no compoſition, nothing but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; therefore in this caſe, ſeeing all is himſelfe, it will follow that his wiſedome is himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe he is the Creator, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all things, therefore he muſt needs know all things; elſe the holy Ghoſt reaſons not ſubſtantially, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 94. <hi>He that planteth the eare, ſhall he not heare?</hi> He intimates thus much, that God knowes all things, becauſe he made all things: And in the 11. verſe, he ſaith, he knowes the thoughts of men that they are but vaine; therefore he muſt needs know all ſecret things; as it is with an Artiſt that hath made a Clock or ſome other inſtrument, that hath motions in it, both ſecret, and open; thoſe that are open he ſeeth, and all others may ſee them, but thoſe that are ſecret none knowes but he that made them; ſo is it with God: Thoſe things which are in man no man knowes, yet the Lord knowes them, becauſe he is the maker of them. Secondly, God governes and guides all things to their proper ends, ſo that he muſt both know the things, and the ends they are made for; he made all things for his owne glory. Thirdly, he ſuſtaines and bears up althings by his power; then he muſt needs know every thing that he hath in his hand. Againe, he is the Judge of all men, then he muſt needs know all, that he may rightly judge; for it is unrighteous judgement, if it be not according to knowledge, but God judgeth righteouſly; I, the Lord, ſearch the heart to give to every one according to his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102519:73"/>works; to add to this, that he is not only a Judge, but a moſt wiſe Judge; that will aſſure any thing upon his own knowledge: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>I will be a ſwift witnes againſt you, ſaith God;</hi> he will be both the Judge, and witnes; therefore he muſt needs know all things.</p>
               <p>Finally, he knowes all things, not ſucceſſively, and by diſcourſe of reaſon, but by one act of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe he is infinite in place, and in time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, and without ending: this is the ſame which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeakes of, that he is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by any time, or place, but by one act of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, knowes all things: and thus much for this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. The firſt uſe then teacheth us that we ſerve the true, and living God, becauſe we ſerve the alknowing God; we may heere diſcerne the true God from falſe gods: Thus the Lord himſelfe in the Prophet, reaſons; Let them bring forth, and ſhew us what ſhall happen; let them ſhew the former things what they be, or declare us things to come; ſhew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that yee are gods, &amp;c. <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 40.21.22.23.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe doth admoniſh men, that they ſhould not conceive too highly of themſelves, for any good that they finde in themſelves, nor yet to pleaſe themſelves with this conceite, that other men doe thinke well of them, becauſe the Lord is infinite in wiſdome; he knowes that by men, that they know not by themſelves, nor doth any other know. This is the eye of the world, that every thing is manifeſt unto: he knowes that by us, that we know not by our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102519:73"/>ſelves, therefore no man ought to pleaſe himſelfe in his owne goodneſſe; God knowes all his thoughts, though never ſo ſecret; both paſt, preſent, and to come: then no reaſon, any ſhould preſume upon any grace; The Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Who can underſtand his owne faults?</hi> no man can but God can: therefore reaſon after this manner, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith: I know and am knowne, I know but in part, but God knowes me and knowes me wholy, but what I know, I know but in part: So the Apoſtle reaſons, I know, nothing of my ſelfe, yet am I not hereby Juſtified; admit, that thou keepeſt thy ſelfe ſo free, and reneweſt thy repentance ſo daily, that thou knoweſt nothing by thy ſelfe, yet marke what the Apoſtle adds farther; notwithſtanding, I doe not judge my ſelfe. I am not hereby juſtified, but he that judgeth me, is the Lord: This is the condition of all men, he that is infinite knowes them; therefore they ſhould not dare to judge themſelves, but (with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi>) intreate the Lord that he would cleanſe them from their ſecret ſinnes.</p>

The third uſe teacheth us, that men ought to feare God, becauſe he is preſent in all places, and infinite in knowledge: Men may have things done behind their backs, which they know not of, but it is not ſo with God; therefore, every man ſhould be wary of himſelfe; even in the ſecret thoughts of his heart, for there is a God that knowes all things: every man muſt beware of ſinne in all places, even in the ſecret places of their owne hearts, for God knowes them: we have a fooliſh proverbe, that thoughts are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102519:74"/>free; free indeed from the law of men, becauſe men know them not, but if men did know them, they were in danger of the law, but they are free by reaſon of mans ignorance, but to God all things are knowne; There are many men that ſeeme to make conſcience of many things, becauſe that God ſees, yet they take liberty to them ſelves in ſecret thoughts, and they thinke God knowes not them; yes, God knowes thy heart better then thy ſelfe: that which thou knoweſt not to be ſinne, he knowes to be ſinne; they that take away ſeeing from God, ſaith <hi>Salvian,</hi> they overthowe the Eſſence of God; they are Atheiſts: he ſees all things, and he knowes all things; therefore take heed of ſecret ſinfull thoughts that men ſee not: Though thou carrie, or colour things, ſo that neither Maſter, nor Servant, nor Wife, nor Husband ſee them, thou haſt a God that ſeeth, and knowes all things, and will bring every thing to judgment; no thing ſo ſecret but he will make knowne: therefore labour (in the feare of God) that thou walk ſecretly, and openly, doeing nothing that is diſpleaſing to God, becauſe thou canſt doe nothing but in the preſence, and privity of God.</p>

               <p>IN order, knowledge is before will; for that we will, we know, and what we know, that we may will; therefore we have firſt handled the wiſedome, and the knowledge of God: and now we are to ſpeake, of the will of God, whereby he willeth thoſe things, that he knowes; for which I have made choice of this text, my will, <hi>or counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will doe all my pleaſure:</hi> In ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of which, we will keepe our order, and firſt ſhew what his will is; the queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the will of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, it is a communicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, whereby it doth freely, and immutably will it ſelfe, and all other things, whatſoever it doth will: the opening of which in the ſeverall parts, will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt this plainly unto us. Firſt, we ſay the will of God, and not the wills of God, becauſe there is but one will of God: and this appeares in as much, as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually the Scripture ſpeakes of it in the number of one, as in this place, <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand:</hi> there is
<pb facs="tcp:102519:75"/>but one will; the like we finde, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand: Matth.</hi> 6.10. our Savi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur hath taught us to pray, <hi>Thy will be done: Ephe.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good pleaſure of his will:</hi> ſo then there is but one will: Againe I ſay, it is a communicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, given to this divine Eſſence; I call it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable (as I ſaid before) not becauſe it is in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it is in God; but becauſe there is the ſame in proportion in man, there is ſome thing like it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it freely, and immutably wills it ſelfe, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: Firſt, the divine Eſſence moſt freely willeth it ſelfe: for howſoever it willeth it ſelfe by neceſſity of nature, yet it willeth freely without any compulſion: ſo as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, in other things, the Lord cannot deny himſelfe; ſo we ſay, the Lord out of the neceſſity of his nature, wills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but yet voluntarily, out of the goodneſſe of his nature: but when he wills other things, there is no ſuch neceſſity of nature, but he wills them moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but whatſoever he wills, he wills freely, out of his owne will, there being no cauſe of Gods will, but the will it ſelfe, which is the cauſe of all cauſes: as appeares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.26. <hi>I thanke thee oh heavenly father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, &amp;c. even ſo, for it is thy good pleaſure.</hi> It is not lawfull for me, to doe what I will with my owne, ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy: he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy:</hi> there is nothing in man that moves him, it is ſtill his will, he wills freely.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:102519:75"/>
               <p>The next thing is, that this will is immutable; that is, when he hath willed, it is without change: this was drawne out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. <hi>The Lord is not as man that he ſhould lie, nor as the ſon of man that he ſhould repent:</hi> the Lord cannot repent: <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, Mal.</hi> 36. <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath ſworne, ſaying: ſurely as I have thought, ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, and as I have purpoſed ſo ſhall it ſtand; Iſai.</hi> 14.24. <hi>He hath ſaid and will he not doe it? Num</hi> 23.19. So that whatſoever he doth will, he wills it alwaies, and eternally; my will ſhall ſtand for ever; God wills from eternity; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he wills, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24. <hi>Thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt determined before to be done.</hi> God might have willed otherwaies before, but when he hath willed, it ſhall ſtand.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, that he wills himſelfe; that as he knowes himſelfe, ſo he wills himſelfe; that is, his owne glory; the willing of himſelfe, is the willing of his own glory: <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. <hi>He hath made all things for himſelfe,</hi> for his owne glory: <hi>I will not give my glory to another;</hi> our Saviour teacheth us to pray principally, <hi>Hallowed be thy name;</hi> a thing moſt to be deſired; and whatſoever you doe, let it be done to the glory of God, ſaith the Apoſtle, thus he wills himſelfe. Secondly, he wills all other things; other things, are of two ſorts, good, and evill; now God wills that which is good, the things which himſelfe doth, are good: <hi>Gen</hi> 1. <hi>He looks upon all that he had made, and loe they were exceeding good. Pſal.</hi> 116.3. <hi>The Lord is in heaven, and doth whatſoever he will:</hi> So he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102519:76"/>hath choſen us according to the good pleaſure of his will; the like may be ſaid of other things, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe good things God wills, for he commands them to be done, and approves them, when they are done; he doth delight in them, and rewards them, that doe them.</p>
               <p>Finally, he wills evill things, and they are of two natures: Firſt the evill of ſinne. Secondly, the evill of puniſhment: the evill of ſinne, doth not properly fall under the will of God; he cannot will ſinne, as ſin: <hi>Thou art not a God that loveſt iniquity: Pſal.</hi> 5.4. therefore in this caſe, it is not willed by God; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it may in ſome reſpect, be ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods will, becauſe he doth permit it: as appeares <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. <hi>The Lord ſuffered all nations to walke in their owne waies:</hi> He ſuffered them, not becauſe he could not hinder every thing from being, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not; when God doth not hinder ſin, he is ſaid to permit it: <hi>Pſal</hi> 81.12. <hi>I gave them up to their owne hearts luſts, to walke according to their own evill wares.</hi> Secondly, the evill of puniſhment, falls under Gods will; here the will of God is the chiefe cauſe; he willingly plagues men with evill, for their neglecting of good; for though there be ſome things in man, which would bring evill upon him, yet the chiefe cauſe is in God: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I create evill, I make peace, I the Lord doe all this: ſhall there be evill in the City, and I not doe it?</hi> Even all evill, the evill of puniſhment, the evill of ſinne, as it is a puniſhment of ſinne commeth from God; and that is manifeſt, in that the Lord hardens mens hearts, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102519:76"/>of precedent hardneſſe, ſo alſo of the lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that were in the mouthes of <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe Prophets. It is ſaid the Lord put a falſe ſpirit into the mouths of them; not as the Author, but as the puniſher of ſinne: ſo it is ſaid, God gave them up to vilde affections, and all this was as a puniſhment. 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 2. God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions, to believe lyes: Finally, adde to this, one thing more, the tranſgreſſions of men, as they are actions come from God, for in God we live, move, and have our being; but as they are tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the law and ſo evill, they are from men. The next queſtion, to amplifie the proofe of this, is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſpeake you of the will of God as of one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe his will is himſelfe, and he is but one, therefore there cannot be many wills; his life is himſelfe, his wiſedome himſelfe, his will himſelfe, nothing in him but himſelfe; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that his will muſt needs be but one; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thus much, that howſoever his will is but one, yet it may be ſaid to be many, in reſpect of us, and that two waies; either in reſpect of the diverſity of the things willed, or in the divers maner of willing; we manifeſt both: Firſt, in reſpect of the diverſity of things willed; there are ſome things in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and ſome things in the New that are divers. Againe he wills ſome things that he will doe to man, and ſomethings he will have done by man, leſt his anger breake out upon him. Secondly, in the divers manner of willing, he wills diverſly; he wills good for it ſelfe, and bad for ſome other good; he wills ſometimes abſolutely, and ſometimes conditionally;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102519:77"/>yet ſo that there is no condition with God, but with us, and according to this manner we are to conceive of the will of God. The next queſtion is;</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you that he wills freely and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe there is nothing before nor greater then the will of God, for which he ſhould doe any thing. Secondly, becauſe he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and moſt wiſe, and cannot be reſiſted. To explane theſe: Firſt, he wills moſt freely, becauſe there was nothing before him, nothing greater then himſelfe; if there were nothing before him, nor grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he, what ſhould move him to will? for that which moves this will, muſt be before and greater then this will; that there was nothing before, nor grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his will, appeares by this, becauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in him, is from his will; therefore it cannot be before, nor greater then his will: thus then there is nothing without God that can move him, neither is there any thing within him; if any thing, it muſt be his knowledge; but beſides that, his knowledge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends further then his will (he knowes things he wils not;) his knowledge and his will are both his Eſſence, one and the ſame thing in God, and therefore to be moved by his knowledge to will, is to be moved by himſelfe; his own Eſſence moves it ſelfe to will. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we ſay he wils immutably, becauſe he is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and moſt wiſe; for if his will be mutable, the mutability of it muſt needs come from one of theſe two; either firſt, becauſe it is reſiſted by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power which cannot be, becauſe he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102519:77"/>as you heard out of the 115. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 3. he hath done whatſoever he will, he is in heaven. Secondly, or elſe becauſe ſome unexpected accident not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene falls out, which occaſions him to reſcinde his determination; but neither can this be, becauſe as it hath beene ſhewed, God knowes all things, both paſt, preſent, and to come, with one moſt ſimple act of underſtanding; as the Apoſtle, knowne unto God are all his workes from the beginning of the world; therefore ſeeing that no power can hinder the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will, who is omnipotent, nor no accident be ſuddaine to him, who is moſt wiſe: It followes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that he wills immutablely. The next que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is;</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why it is ſaid that he wills himſelf and other things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe the object of his will is good, or goodneſſe, therefore he muſt needs principally will himſelfe, for he is goodneſſe it ſelfe; he wills himſelfe principally, becauſe himſelfe is the chiefeſt good, and chiefeſt to be beloved. In other caſes, whatſoever he wills, he wills it as in himſelfe; the object of the underſtanding is truth; falſehood doth not fall into the underſtanding, but by reaſon of truth; God underſtands himſelfe, as being the firſt truth, and other things in himſelfe. The object of the will is goodneſſe; God is the chiefeſt good, and therefore he wills himſelfe firſt, and he wills other things that are good as they are good, and as they have in them impreſſions of his Image, and as they tend to him that is the principall good, and ſo he wills every thing.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102519:78"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why then doth he will evill?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it is the execution of juſtice, and ſo good, for it is good which is juſt; for whatſoever is juſt, is certainely good; if it be evill, yet if it be the execution of juſtice, it is good; whereupon the ſinnes of men which are brought as puniſhments of ſinners, are good. Thus ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> this is the Juſtice of God, but not the ſinfulneſſe of God; this is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Juſtice, and ſo good: and thus I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and explaned the Doctrine of the will of God, &amp;c. By order we are to come to the uſes, but there are many doubts, whether the will of God be free, and unchangeable, but out of many, we will ſpeak but of a few.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> To will freely, and immutably, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, for freedome is that which is mutable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a freedome, where there is immutability, for immutability takes not away the freedome of actions. <hi>Adam</hi> was created with a free will to good, and evill: <hi>Adam,</hi> now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, hath a free will, onely to good: the Divells, and damnned have an immutable will to evill, and yet free, and Gods wil is moſt immutable, and yet moſt free. God wils himſelfe by the neceſſity of nature, he cannot doe otherwiſe, but muſt needs will him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and yet this he doth moſt freely, becauſe not by conſtraint or compulſion: God wills other things, not out of any ſuch neceſſity, he might not have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that which he doth will, or he might have willed another thing then what he wills, but when he hath once determined his owne will, it remaines for ever.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102519:78"/>Immutably determined from the neceſſity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for God cannot denie himſelf: this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will, was moſt free: meerely, and only from himſelfe. In a word, to will freely, and to will immutably are not oppoſite, but are in God, who wils all things out of himſelf freely, becauſe he might have not willed them; and immutably, becauſe having willed them, he will not, nor can he reſcinde his own decree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The will of God is not immutable becauſe he changeth his will; for he willeth one thing under the law and he abolliſhes that, and wils another thing under the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is eaſie, there is no change in the will of God; for whatſoever was done in time, was willed from all eternity; he willed that, that which was under the law, ſhould be for a time, and then be changed; and willed that, which is under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhould ſucceede it, and continew, and this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manifeſtation of the will of God, is but the execution of his will, which was from eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Lord is ſaid to repent: <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. <hi>It repented the Lord that he made man;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.15. <hi>It repented the Lord that he had made Saul King,</hi> therfore his will is not immutable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is thus, there is no change in God, but in the workes that are done by God: Theſe ſpeeches are figurative; God is not as man that he ſhould repent, but is ſayd to repent when he doth in time make a change in the matters of the world, which he had decreed ſhould be changed before the world was.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> One thing more he threatens ſomtimes and never does it, nor never meant it: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. As to <hi>Hezechias; Put thy houſe in order for thou ſhalt die:</hi> So <hi>Ionah.</hi> 3. <hi>Yet fourty daies and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> yet neither <hi>Hezechiah</hi> died, nor <hi>Nineveh</hi> was deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is, you muſt marke the difference betwixt the denouncing, and underſtanding of theſe threatnings; theſe are abſolutely denounced, but not to be abſolutely underſtood, but with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that ſtands after this manner; namely, if they doe not uſe the meanes to prevent it; and they are ſuch meanes as hee hath appointed: <hi>Hezechiah</hi> prayed earneſtly, and the other repented, for the Lord had a purpoſe that <hi>Hezechiah</hi> ſhould live ſtill; and hee threatned death to ſtirre him up to prayer; he purpoſed, <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould not be deſtroyed, and threatned deſtruction, that by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it might be prevented: and this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, for in <hi>Iere.</hi> 18.7.8. <hi>If I ſpeake againſt a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. If that Nation repent, I will repent alſo;</hi> where the change is not in him, but in them; it is in other things, not in God. A man walks by a Church, backwards, and forwards, and the Church ſtanding ſtill, is ſomtimes on his right hand, and ſomtimes on his leſt hand; there are changes, not in the Church, which is not moved, but in him that walketh too and fro; ſo God, ſometimes is on the right hand of men, and ſomtimes on the left hand; that is, when they change: So that this is a full anſwer to this: and this is a profitable anſwer that Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> hath;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102519:79"/>God doth not know how to alter his counſell, but how to alter his ſentence: the reaſon is, that the Lord doth not alwaies pronounce ſentence, according to his counſell, but according to the ſecond cauſes, or according to the mindes of them, to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth it: as <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was taken with ſickneſſe, no way thinkes he but death; this was his ſentence, but Gods counſell was, that he ſhould live: and ſo when he ſaith, <hi>Yet forty daies and Nineveh ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied:</hi> his ſentence was, that it ſhould be deſtroied; but his counſell was, that it ſhould be ſaved: the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory pronouncing of his ſentence, makes way to his counſell;<note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. l. 1. c. 8.</note> becauſe it is that which ſtirs them up to repentance, ſo that there is no alteration in this; for if he had a purpoſe to have deſtroied, then he would not have threatned but deſtroied: and thus much we have ſeen of the will of God.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer to this, is taken from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what kindes of ſinners the Lord ſpeaks; of ſinners, ſome be penitent, that ſee, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves ſinners, and ſorrow for, and turne from their ſinnes, and cry, and fly unto Chriſt for ſalvation; God doth not will the death of ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, neither ſhall they die: <hi>But he that confeſſeth and for ſaketh his ſinnes ſhall finde mercy;</hi> but others be obſtinate, and hardened in ſinne, that adde drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thirſt, and rebellion to ſinne, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; God will laugh at theſe, when their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth; ſo then, as long as God is pleaſed with repentance, and pardoneth the penitent, there is no
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102519:80"/>alteration in God, though the impenitent periſh; nay, there would be alteration in him, if they did not periſh: or it may be ſaid, and truly, that God is better pleaſed with the repentance, then with the perdition of a ſinner; there is joy in Heaven, over one ſinner that repents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Againe it is objected, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>That God would have all men ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> How ſhould it be then, that any ſhould periſh, unleſſe his will be changeable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Ambroſe</hi> upon this place of the Apoſtle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it thus: God will have all men to be ſaved, but ſo as they come to him, he will have them ſaved; if they will ſalvation to themſelves; and if this ſenſe be admitted, there is no ſhaddow of change in God, though many be not ſaved, becauſe thoſe many that are not ſaved, doe not ſeeke ſalvation: Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> underſtands All; not collectively, for every ſingular man, but diſtributively, for ſome of all ſorts of men; in which ſenſe it is uſed, in other places of Scripture, and ſo the meaning may be, God will have all men ſaved; that is, all ſorts of men, Jewes, Greekes, bond, free, Kings, and Subjects, ſaved: and therefore praiers muſt be made for all ſorts of men, and in this ſenſe, there is no change in Gods will; though ſome of all ſorts periſh, becauſe ſome of all ſorts be ſaved; as in the Arke: God ſaved from the deluge all living creatures, not in the particular, but in the kinde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaved ſome of every ſort: againe, Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> in another place, explanes it thus: God wills all ſhould be ſaved, becauſe all that are ſaved, are ſaved
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102519:81"/>by Gods will; as a Phyſitian is ſaid to cure all, who cures all that are cured: and for this cauſe, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle enjoines, that praiers ſhould be made to God for all; becauſe without God none can be ſaved: and if we ſo expound it, though many be not ſaved, yet there is no change in Gods will, who wills the ſalvation of all that are ſaved: <hi>As in Chriſt all are ſaid to be made alive,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. becauſe all that are made alive, are made alive by Chriſt: ſo in this place, in the ſame reſpect, may God be ſaid to will the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men: adde to theſe our faith, thus; God will have all men ſaved, he wills the ſalvation even of the reprobate, as a thing in it ſelfe good, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the diſpoſition of a gracious God: but yet he doth not determine, or appoint it, and therefore though many periſh, there is no change in Gods will: this place ſhewing what God might approve of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, not what he determined to doe; he wills it by an antecedent will, as in it ſelfe conſidered; but not with a conſequent will, and here is no change in Gods will; finally we anſwer, that by all, may be underſtood the, all, of the elect; not of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>The free gift came upon all men, to the juſtification of life:</hi> that is, in the verſe following, <hi>By the righteouſneſſe of one, many are made righteous;</hi> this, all, is many: ſo that when he ſaith, that God would have all to be ſaved, the meaning is, all that he purpoſeth to ſave; I determine nothing which of theſe interpretations ſhould be followed, but leave that to every learned and judicious readers choice; ſecure of this, that which ſoever is preferred, Gods
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102519:81"/>will doth ſtill remaine Immutable, and without ſhaddow of change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The uſe is, that if the will of God be free, and no cauſe without God, can move him to will, then it followes, that they er re that thinke, and teach, that God is moved to beſtow ſome good thing on man, becauſe he foreſees ſome good thing in him: I ſay, this confuteth their error; for if this were ſo, then Gods will were not free; but it is free, therefore this is erroneous: Earthly Princes caſt their benefits upon thoſe that have no deſert; how much more doth God who is not, as earthly Princes; but much more great, and more free, in conferring of his benefits; more bleſſed, and glorious, then that he can be either engaged, or recompenced: and indeed, what could any man doe, before he was, to make God his Debtor, what workes could he doe that was not? <hi>Ob.</hi> But God might foreſee, he would worke. <hi>Anſ.</hi> If God did foreſee this, the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. would not have cried out, <hi>Oh the depth both of the wiſedome and counſell, of God:</hi> here is no place for Pelagians, and Papiſts, they cannot ſee the depth of his counſell, though they be ſo quick, and acute, that they can ſee that which the Apoſtle could not.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> preſſing this againſt the Pelagians; The Apoſtle (ſaith he) ſpeakes after this manner, <hi>Oh the riches of his mercy!</hi> then not of workes, then not for foreſeen workes: and indeed, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> could he not well have ſaid, but of future workes, or workes to come; but he knew that the will of God was free.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:102519:82"/>
               <p>Then to ſhut up this, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in a caſe of Infants, the one is baptized, the other not; the one is ſaved, the other not: I demand ſaith he, why God did ſave the one and deſtroy the other? will you ſay it was becauſe he did foreſee the one would be good, and the other evill? this would be injuſtice in God, to damne him for that he never did; ſeeing he takes them away, before they knew good, or evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This teaches men, that if they have any ſenſe of Gods calling, and that they are elected of God, and made partakers of the grace, and mercy of God, not to be puffed up; becauſe it is the free will of God, that hath choſen them: the more any man hath received of God, the more indebted he is, and ſhould learn to be the more humble: let no man advance himſelfe againſt another; what haſt thou that thou haſt not received? and who hath cauſed thee to differ from another? thou art moſt proud, and boaſteſt moſt of thy ſelfe; boaſt onely of that which is thy owne; it is vanity, to boaſt of that which is not thine, thou haſt nothing thy owne but ſinne; nothing is due to ſinne, but ſhame, and death; thou couldeſt doe nothing to helpe thy ſelfe out of this condition; if thou art delivered out of it, be not high minded, it is God that delivered thee, and not thy ſelfe, of his free grace, not according to thy merits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This teacheth us, that if a man have once aſſurance of election, and ſalvation, he may have it for ever; as he was choſe freely, ſo alſo immutably; God cannot change his will; ſo that here is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102519:82"/>of a man that hath any aſſurance; God is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, therefore I cannot periſh: So then, is any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Sathan or from his owne weakneſſe, when he ſeeth ſo much rebellion in himſelfe, and when he heares great Doctors teach that a man may be good to day and nought to morrow? this may comfort him, God is immutable; this is that I ſtand upon, God is immutable, therefore none can reſiſt him; there is corruption enough in man, but God is not overcome by the wickedneſſe of man, but as he will puniſh thoſe that ſtand unreformed, ſo hee will bee good to thoſe that walke before him humbly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I, but ſay they, Gods ſalvation ſtands upon condition; and being upon condition, therfore is changeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer; that the faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them which have it, is mutable in them, and may in it ſelfe be loſt; but it is God that wrought it, it is God that will not forſake his owne worke; it is God by whoſe power we are kept to ſalvation, and have not our faith, repentance, life, ſalvation in our owne keeping: A man of himſelfe may fall away, but God gives him perſeverance: <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, This guift of perſeverance may be humbly ſought of God, and when a man hath it, he ſhall not with <hi>Caine</hi> be caſt out; for God is ſo good, that he will never ſuffer a man to goe ſo farre as that he ſhould cut himſelfe from him: and what is the reaſon? for the ſeed of God abideth in him.</p>
               <p>In the firſt converſion, a man is unwilling and retains
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102519:83"/>grace unwillingly, but God gives him grace to make him willing; ſo that the grace he hath, and the eſtate he hath, he holds it not by his owne will, but ſo that God keepes it; for otherwaies the heart of man, would ſoone goe from God; whereupon it followes, that God and his will are immutable.</p>
               <p>The next queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the truth of the Divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a communicable Attribute, whereby he knowes all things certainely without any igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or error, ſpeaking and working, indeed, and in truth, without fraud and diſſimulation, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming conſtantly, whatſoever he hath ſaid. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane theſe: Firſt, I ſay, it is the truth of God, (not truths, though there be many) yet the Scripture ſpeakes, but of one, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, it is a communicable Attribute, becauſe that howſoever truth is in a ſpeciall manner Attributed to God; yet it is by proportion in man, whereby he knowes all things without error; for it is a generall ſpeech, he is a true man that knowes all things without any ignorance, or error; ſuch is the truth of God, without any ignorance, and error, he cannot deceive, nor be deceived, he knowes all things whatſoever; he cannot deceive, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7.13. He tells the truth, the ſpirit leads into truth, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived. All things are naked, and bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, with whom we have to doe.</p>
               <p>Againe whatſoever he hath ſpoken, and wrought is in truth, and indeed without faining, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation; ſo that there is no active falſitie in his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102519:83"/>waies, he deceives none in any of his words, or in any of his deeds.</p>
               <p>The truth of the word is, when the words are anſwerable, and agreeable to the truth of the minde: for when a man ſpeakes otherwaies then he knowes, is to lye; the old deſcription of a lye is, for a man to tell a thing contrary to his owne minde: Now then whatſoever is in God is true, and ſo the Apoſtle ſpeakes; let God be true, and every man a lyer; and againe, when we came to you, our words were not, yea, and nay, but yea; that is, a certaine truth: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.7. <hi>The works of God are true: Pſal.</hi> 119.51. <hi>The lawe of the Lord is true,</hi> and this might be ſhewed in all the works of creation, regeneration, and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they are all true works.</p>
               <p>Againe, conſtantly performing whatſoever he ſpeakes, this is made manifeſt in his promiſes, and threatnings; whatſoever he hath promiſed or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, ſhall come to paſſe. A man is a true man when he hath done that he ſaid he would doe: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89 33.34.35. <hi>I never falſifie my truth, I have ſworne, and looke what I have ſayd I will performe; heaven and earth ſhall paſſe, but not one jot, or tittle, of my word ſhall paſſe: Pſal.</hi> 119.19. <hi>Thy word endures for ever: Iſai.</hi> 40.6. <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, but the word of the Lord endures for ever:</hi> God will accompliſh, and doe all thoſe things that he hath promiſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>All the premiſes are, yea, and amen, in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid truth, as ſpeaking of one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe though there be many truths in words, and works of men, yet all flow from one truth: as all
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102519:84"/>light comes from one ſunne, ſo all truth comes from one God, he is the truth: as his goodneſſe is the cauſe of all good, ſo his truth is the cauſe of all truth.</p>
               <p>Truth, is either morall, or metaphyſicall; and this either in the minde of God, or in the minde of the creature, or in the things that exiſt: Truth in the mind of God, is that certaine and diſtinct knowledge, and Idea of the nature of things, according to which they are created in time: Truth in the minde of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Angells, or men, conſiſts in the apprehenſion, and knowledge of things, as they are in themſelves: Truth in the things that exiſt, is their exiſtens it ſelfe, ſutable to their Idea in the minde of God: The truth in the minde of God, is that which the Schooles call <hi>exemplar is,</hi> or the patterne truth, and is but one, and firſt is in God, and from thence conveighed to the things, and mindes in which it is. Truth is in things, and the mindes of men formally, as the Schooles ſpeake; and ſo there are many truths, but all derived from the firſt truth, in the minde of God; and they are firſt in the things knowne, and then in the underſtanding, that knoweth: Truth in the mind of God, meaſures the truth in things, and minds of men, but is not meaſured by them: Truth in things, meaſures the truth in the mindes of men, and is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the truth in the mind of God: Truth in the minde of man is meaſured by both thoſe truths; and is not the meaſure of them. And thus we ſee truth is but one, becauſe all flowes from one; there is no truth in things, which God implants not in them, nor
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102519:84"/>in the minds of men, which the ſpirit of truth doth not lead into: No man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt: Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, whatſoever truth is in any man, is from God; and all lies are from the divell, he is the father of them: when the Saints and holy men have lied, it came from the Divell: when wicked men ſpeake truth (as <hi>Cayphas</hi> ſpeaking of the death of Chriſt) it came from God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you, he knowes all things certainly without error?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is of infinite wiſdome: his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is infinite as himſelfe: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. A finite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may erre, becauſe it doth not know all things perfectly: but infinite wiſdome apprehends all things perfectly: therefore it cannot erre.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you he ſpeakes and workes truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faining and diſsimulation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is the chiefeſt good, into which no evill can fall: God is the chiefeſt good; then diſſembling cannot befall God: there can be no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him, becauſe he is light it ſelfe: then no falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood fals into God, becauſe he is truth it ſelfe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, faining and diſſembling is the corruption of the underſtanding, this cannot fall into God.</p>
               <p>The workes of Sathan, when they are good works, are diſſembling: as when he teſtifieth of Chriſt, that he was the Sonne of God, it was a lying ſpeech; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever he doeth, he doeth it to deceive: for if men will beleeve him in one thing, he hopes they will in another: and ſo all the works of Sathan
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102519:85"/>are lying works: but on the other ſide, all the works of God are good, and ſo certain and true without fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doth he conſtantly performe whatſoever he hath ſpoken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is faithfull, and juſt to performe whatſoever he hath promiſed or threatned. Promiſes he any thing? he will performe it, becauſe he is true: and this is verifyed by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.8. <hi>That thou mighteſt know that the Lord thy God is a faithfull God, that will keepe covenant and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> Mercy makes him promiſe, but truth makes him performe Promiſes. Juſtice makes him threaten, and truth makes him recompence, his enemies to their face. Thus Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, God hath made himſelfe our Debter by promiſes: and <hi>Bernard,</hi> that man ſhould pay that he promiſeth, becauſe he makes himſelfe a debter: and if the Lord keepes his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes with thoſe that are unworthy, will he not much more keepe them with thoſe he hath made worthy in his Sonne?</p>

               <p>YOU have heard the laſt day, the deſcription of the trueth of God: both what it was, and the confirmation of the ſeverall parts of it: and now we will lay downe ſome Uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt: If God be true in word and work, this ſerves to awaken up ſecure men, and to rouſe them out of their naturall ſecurity. Theſe uſually bleſſe themſelves when they heare the judgements of God threatned againſt them, and ſee them not preſently executed: I ſay, they bleſſe themſelves, becauſe God doth forbeare, and is not a word and a blow; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay they, the Lord will neither doe good nor evill, howſoever his Prophets, the Miniſters ſpeake thus. But let them know, the Lord is true, and while they thus ſpeake, or thinke of him, they make him a lyer: they beleeve not the truth, and hereupon it is, that <hi>they ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornfull, Pſal.</hi> 1.1. ſcorne and ſcoffe at thoſe meanes which holy men uſe, to eſcape judgement; I meane, prayer, and faſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make God a lyer. But theſe men ſhall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102519:86"/>know, that the patience of God ſhould lead them to repentance; and therefore the Lord ſpeakes, becauſe he would ſhew mercy; he could execute as well as ſpeak; but they do abuſe the patience of God, to bring upon themſelves greater damnation. God is true, and every man a lyer, and their deceitfull hearts that have deceived them, God ſhall awaken: For moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, true it is, that God will make good his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, he will ſhew himſelfe true in executing his judgements, in his due time. He hath his owne time for mercy, and for judgement, and he will puniſh them who carry it out the moſt ſtoutly: for the Lord hath ſpoken againſt them, and they ſhall feele it with a heavie hand. And therefore though he doe delay, let them not be ſecure, judgement will be the more heavy when it comes.</p>
               <p>The wiſe man in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. ſpeaking to the yong man, ſaith, <hi>Goe toyong man, take thy pleaſure;</hi> goe on you young men, and alſo ancient men; <hi>but know,</hi> for all this, <hi>God ſhall bring you to judgement.</hi> God is true, he hath ſaid it, and ſhall he not doe it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.4, 5. they then ſhall be as ſtubble before the winde: therefore be awakened out of that blindeneſſe and ſecurity, or elſe you ſhall know it to your coſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Here is matter of comfort to every one that reſts upon God by faith, and conſtant obedience: for that which he hath promiſed, their faith ſhall never faile; God is true, it is builded upon God, and his word and trueth; that is the comfort of every one that beleeveth, that he ſhall obtaine that which he hopes for. Certainly, God ſhall make it good, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102519:86"/>to his trueth: therefore, if any man finde weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith; if any man be troubled with doubting, What is the comfort? It is not our faith that makes the promiſe here, but the promiſe makes our faith ſure: if God be true, and perpetually true, certainly God ſhall make it good; and whoſoever thou be that buildeſt upon God in that caſe, he will performe it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>I know whom I have beleeved,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> ſome expound this place thus; As a man that hath a great debt to pay, and relyes upon other men for the money, and ſome caſt doubts in his minde, what if they ſhould faile you? the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>I know whom I have beleeved:</hi> ſo that having taſted of the ſweetneſſe of God in his ſoule, ſaith, <hi>I know whom I have beleeved:</hi> ſo ought every man to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. that howſoever there be doubtings, he may have joy: the holy man <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſtedfaſt in beleeving, becauſe he knew he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe what he had promiſed: we neede not be weake in faith, becauſe he is true: as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of the Promiſes, ſaith, they are thy Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whom ſhould we feare? It is trueth that hath promiſed, that cannot deceive, neither can be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So that if a man beleeves, here will be comfort, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.11. <hi>I know the thought I have toward thee;</hi> of peace, and not of evill: but how will he doe it? and when will he doe it? God knowes how to doe it, though we ſee no means how it ſhould come to paſſe; let us leave to God his owne worke, the effecting his gracious promiſes, and be imployed in the worke that concernes our ſelves (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith;) when
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102519:87"/>God promiſes feare not, only doe that we ought to doe, to draw ſuch promiſes upon our ſelves, for God never failes his.</p>

The third uſe is to exhort to imitation: every one that thinks himſelfe Gods, muſt be like God, though he cannot bee perfectly like him, yet he muſt have truth in every thing; trueth in ſpeech, trueth in performance, &amp;c. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> being asked what that was that makes a man moſt like the Gods: when they ſpeake truly ſaith he; but <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was a lyer, and all the gods of the nations were lyars; yet they ſaw this trueth, that, that which made a man ſpecially like to God, was to ſpeake truth; every man ought to labour to ſpeake truth: All lies muſt be laid a ſide, for he is the child of the divel that makes ſporte of a lye: There be officious lyes, as to lye for a mans benefit; yet as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwers Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> this makes a man, that when he tells the trueth hee ſhould not bee believed; and this alſo makes them unlike to God: So alſo there bee pernitious lyes which are worſt of all, as when men lye for the hurt of others; this makes men moſt unlike God: put away lying ſaith the Apoſtle, and every man ſpeake the trueth to his neighbour: So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ought to be conſtant, and faithfull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme whatſoever he promiſes, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Let your yea be yea, and looke that what you ſay that you performe;</hi> Gods promiſes are yea and amen, ſo every mans word muſt be certainely kept in things lawfull, and holy: Gods promiſes are all made in wiſdome, mans in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: this is that for which every man ought to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102519:87"/>labour, even to performe, what he promiſes. We muſt be wary what we promiſe, and carefull that we performe; for it is lying to promiſe a thing, and never meane to performe it: yea it is an impious thing, for he that is unfaithfull in the leſſe, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull in the greater; if not, yet his faithfulneſſe is not for love of the truth: the refore men muſt conſider what they promiſe, as <hi>Act.</hi> 5.4. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ananias, Was it not thine owne?</hi> but when hee promiſed it, he put himſelfe out of his owne power.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But is a man alwaies bound to performe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he promiſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is, yes, except in theſe and the like caſes. Firſt, if a man can get him ſelfe free by him to whom he hath promiſed: becauſe he that bound him may free him; and if he ſhall free him, a man needs not performe his promiſe, and yet ſtand free ſtill. Secondly, a man may promiſe a thing he underſtands not to be unlawful, yet afterwards comes to ſee that it was unlawfull, then he is free, not to keep it, and yet remaines true. As if a man ſhould promiſe to conceale a ſecret prejudicall to the ſtate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; or an apprentice ſhould promiſe to waſt, or give away his maſters goods: In theſe, and ſuch caſes they were bound to be humble for, and repent of the raſhneſſe of their promiſes, and are not tied to the performance of them. Theſe and ſuch like caſes excepted, promiſes are alwaies to be kept.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is, plaine dealing is a jewell, for it will alwaies more honor a man, and comfort him
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102519:88"/>both living, and dying, then all that is got by decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by lying, and diſſembling; by officious lyes, or pernitious lyes: But this is prophanely added, that he that uſeth it will die a begger; but I ſay, he that uſeth it not, ſhall die much worſe then a beaſt: for a beaſt hath not any underſtanding, and therefore he ſhall never come to judgement; but man hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and therefore ſhall come to judgement; even he that was afraid to die a begger, ſhall come to judgement: ſuch deceitful men, the holy one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes out of heaven: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>The next attribute is, goodneſſe, and that belongs to the will of God; of that gooneſſe of God we are to ſpeake now; and therefore to avoyde all diſtinction according to our order, the queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the goodnes of God; and of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is: It is a communicable attribute, whereby it is abſolute in, and of it ſelfe, good, liberall, and bountifull, communicating good to the creature; This being the deſcription, we muſt open the ſeverall parts: and firſt, the anſwer ſaith that God is good, liberall, &amp;c. (and this is true:) But yet to expreſſe the extention of that we have in hand; I ſay further that he is goodneſſe it ſelfe. God is an accident, and no accident is in God; God is good, and whatſoever is in God is good: God is good, and ſuch a good as hath no evil annexed to it; as that which is truly heate, is not mixed with any cold: and that which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſweet, is not mixed with any ſowre; ſo God is ſuch, as that whatſoever is in him is eſſentiall. Thus
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102519:88"/>we finde in Scripture, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.1. <hi>Why boaſteſt thou thy ſelfe, thou cruell man? ſeeing the goodneſſe of God, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 2.14. The bountifulneſſe of God, that is the godneſſe of God: ſo the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. Secondly, I call it a communicable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, becauſe this goodneſſe is in ſome proportion in man, though not as it is in God: therefore we call it communicable, not that there is goodneſſe in man, as it is in God; but a goodneſſe whereby we reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the divine nature, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. The next thing, that he is good, in, and of himſelfe: the ground of this, is that which Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Why calleſt thou me good? there is none good but God.</hi> There are good men, but there are none eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and eſſentially good, but God. There is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted goodneſſe, and there is an uncreated goodneſſe; and therefore we ſay, he is good in and of himſelfe, and is good to the creatures: and this the Learned call a relative goodneſſe. This goodneſſe in the extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (not eſſentially relative, as it is in the three perſons is here ment) but a relative betweene the creature and God: and this is the ſame <hi>Gen</hi> 1.13. <hi>And he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that he had made, and behold it was very good:</hi> ſo in many other things, <hi>Pſal</hi> 118.1. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord becauſe he is good, and his mercy, &amp;c.</hi> he is good ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy; that is, his bountifulneſſe continues for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>However, God is good to Iſrael.</hi> The goodneſſe of God admits this diviſion; ſome is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, ſome temporall, ſome generall, and ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Common goodneſſe he ſhewes to all, but his ſpeciall he ſhewes but to ſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11. The Lord
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102519:89"/>is a ſunne, and ſhield, and he will give grace, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: what to every man? no: but to the pure in heart. So Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.10. If a ſonne aske his father bread, will he give him a ſtone? If you, being evill, can give good things to your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly father give his holy ſpirit to thoſe that aske it of him? as <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. <hi>he maketh the ſunne to ſhine upon the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 14.7. he hath not left himſelfe without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in that he hath filled our hearts with food and gladneſſe; that as we know the goodneſſe of the tree by the fruit thereof, ſo we know this goodneſſe of God by the fruits thereof in the creatures: and ſo we have this deſcription proved. The next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is ſuch a goodneſſe attributed to God, and his divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe he is deſired of all, and above all. Secondly, Becauſe he communicates his goodneſſe freely. To explane theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe God is deſired of all, and above all: The object of the will is good; for the will deſires nothing, but that which is good either truely, or at leaſt in appearance. Trueth is the object of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; whatſoever the underſtanding imployes it ſelfe about, is trueth: ſo, whatſoever the will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes it ſelfe about, is goodneſſe: nothing is good but God, and nothing can be good, but it is deſired. Now then if goodneſſe be that which all deſire, and if all deſires be bent upon goodneſſe, it muſt needs follow that all muſt deſire God, the author of all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102519:89"/>goodneſſe: as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, thou haſt made our hearts for thy ſelfe, becauſe thou art goodneſſe: or thus, thou haſt made us for thee, and our heart is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at quiet till it come to thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, Becauſe he communicates his goodneſſe to others: this is the onely property of goodneſſe, that it will communicate it ſelfe. The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more holy any man is, the more he deſires to make himſelfe common; <hi>The good man is mercifull, and lendeth, Pſal.</hi> 145. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. <hi>God is good to all:</hi> and his goodneſſe is ſeene in the workes of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and in the workes of redemption, and the worke of his deſpoſing of all things: thus we ſhall finde he communicates his goodneſſe to all. The next queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid that he is abſolute good, in, and of himſelfe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, Becauſe his goodneſſe is perfect; It is infinite, therefore cannot be from others. It is eternall: What is eternal, but to have being when all other things are nothing? Who then can make that which is eternall? Hence it muſt needes be that God is good, in, and of himſelfe. But beſides this, his goodneſſe is perfect: whatſoever is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others by participation, is imperfect, but Gods goodneſſe is not imperfect, therefore it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by participation, but is abſolute in and of it ſelfe. In him goodneſſe is moſt perfect, in us it is unperfect; as the heat that is in the Sunne is perfect, but the reflection is imperfect; the reaſon is, becauſe the heat is moſt principally in the Sunne: So the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102519:90"/>goodneſſe that is in others is imperfect, but the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is perfect. If he ſhould receive his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it muſt be finite; if finite, then imperfect. A fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and imperfect creature cannot communicate infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and perfect goodneſſe, of which themſelves are not capable. Therefore we ſee that God is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in his goodneſſe by any, but is good, in, and of himſelfe. The next queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid that he communicates good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and is good to all creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, Becauſe what goodneſſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is begun, and continued in any, is from God, and the cauſe is in him onely. It is not the creatures owne goodneſſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.11. <hi>The goodneſſe of God hath made my mountaine to ſtand ſtrong:</hi> where he ſheweth that this eſtate and condition wherein he was, was nothing from himſelfe, all came from God. Therefore when as <hi>Eſau</hi> asked <hi>Iacob,</hi> how he came by that wealth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.11. <hi>The Lord hath bin good to me, &amp;c.</hi> therefore I have all meerely of his goodneſſe: and hereupon <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.10. <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt of all thy mercies:</hi> where he cals Gods goodneſſe, his mercy, becauſe it comes from the mercy of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Lord, what am I?</hi> ſaid David, <hi>or what is my fathers houſe, &amp;c?</hi> So every man may ſay, whatſoever he is, whatſoever he hath; Lord, what am I, that thou haſt brought me to this, &amp;c? So, whatſoever any man hath, it comes from the goodneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>There be many Uſes of this point, but we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with ſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe, is briefly this: It teacheth us
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102519:90"/>that, of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is true, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.13. <hi>God tempts no man, God is not tempted;</hi> why? his goodneſſe, is ſuch; that which is good of it ſelfe, hath no evill mixed with it: hony hath no ſowre in it, the ſun hath no darkneſſe, God nothing but good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo that this is true, <hi>God tempts no man:</hi> the ground why man is tempted, is in himſelfe, not in God; becauſe there is no evill in God: tempting is when there is ſome ſetting upon, and receiving an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, with rejection: how can a man caſt darts into the ſun? God being good in himſelfe, &amp;c. cannot tempt nor be tempted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, this teacheth us that we ſhould not ſinne againſt this God; the reaſon is, becauſe he is good, nay, becauſe he is goodneſſe; therefore we ought not, this ſhould be a reſtraint to us: how doth every man condemne wrongs done to a poore innocent, that hath done no evill? ſo if we ſee a man full of goodneſſe brought to miſery, every man will cry out of them, that brought him to it: and do we ſo in reſpect of men, ought we not ſo to reaſon in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God? that if God be ſo good in himſelf, why ſhould I commit this wickedneſſe, againſt him? when Sathan tempts, the world provokes, &amp;c. What ſhould be the anſwer, if I ſhould commit ſuch a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, you your ſelves, and Sathan would accuſe me, for ſinning againſt ſuch a good God? and indeed the divill inticeth to ſin, for nothing, but to accuſe us when we have ſinned; therefore get thee behind me Sathan; ſhall I ſinne againſt this God? that is not only ſo good in himſelfe, but is good to all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102519:91"/>looke which way thou wilt, thou canſt not but ſee the goodneſſe of God: Oh what ingratitude! what impiety were this, for a man to offend this God, that is ſo good in himſelfe, and good to all creatures? and why hath God ſhewed thee this goodneſſe? but becauſe he would have thee good to him: S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath this ſaying, for a man to do good for good, is naturall, &amp; for a man to do evill for good, is diabolicall: now then if there be but ſo much as common reaſon, we will returne good for good; but to returne evill for good, is diveliſh; and the more good any man hath received, the more good he ought to be; as <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaith: God hath given us good; then we ought to be good to him againe: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what good thou haſt in thy creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and renewing; let it be a provocation, to returne good againe to God, or elſe the more ſhall be thy condemnation: let every man therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after this manner, to anſwer the goodneſſe of God, that herein may be his comfort; for then we are beſt to our ſelves, when we returne good againe; and worſe to our ſelves, when we returne evill; therefore we ought thus to approve our goodneſſe to him, and have this ever upon our hearts: how doth the goodneſſe of God call for obedience, that we may glorifie God heer, and then by him, we may be glorious in the life to come?</p>

               <p>ACcording to our order, the next that followed, was the goodneſſe of God; and as you heard what it was, namely a communicable Attribute, &amp;c. whereby God was abſolutely good of himſelfe, &amp;c. the parts of which, have been explaned, and you heard we have made two uſes, according as time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us; there now remaines divers other uſes, that might be made of this, but to teach two more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. The uſe now (which is the third) is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our faith, againſt the Heretiques, and Hereſies concerning God: Firſt, againſt <hi>Sardian,</hi> who firſt raiſed up, and after him, <hi>Marcion,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, wrot that the God who was the creator, was not good, as the ſtory reports; this <hi>Marcion</hi> being ſome times of the Church, fell into uncleaneſſe, and being deprived of the Communion of the Church, and ſo caſt out, for deflouring of a Virgin, he in envy taught, that God the creator was not good; but we ſee by this deſcription, which I have given of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the falſhood of this hereſie; for God is good, and there is no evill comes from him, as it is evill;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102519:92"/>(though the evill of puniſhment comes from him,) for from that which is good, as it is good, no evill can come; therefore when evills of judgement comes from God, they are good: Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, he had a conference with a <hi>Marcionite,</hi> and he reaſoned thus: God was good, ſaith he, if he would not take account for ſinne; but ſeeing he doth take an account for ſin, he is not good: <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, I anſwer thee <hi>Marcionite;</hi> that God is good, becauſe he doth take account of ſinne; for if men now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Lions, and Beares, when God doth take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſinne; what would they doe, if God ſhould take no account of ſin? I diſpute with thee <hi>Marcionite,</hi> (ſaith the father) thou haſt a family, if thy ſervants deſpiſe thee, and thy government, and beat thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; thou do nothing to them, tell me whether this were good in thee, or no? every man will conclude no; and ſhould we make God idle, that will ſuffer men to do what they liſt; therefore we ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is very good, though he take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. The fourth uſe is, whoſoever, hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any good from God, ſpirituall, or temporall, outward, or inward, it teaches him, that he ſhould be thankfull to God; thankes ought to be returned, but you will ſay,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall we be thankfull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, two waies; in word, and in deed; we muſt uſe the goods we receive, and uſe them well; whoſoever is unthankfull in word, he is alſo in deed unthankfull: he that uſeth not his talent, or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102519:92"/>uſeth it not well, whatſoever his words be, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull to God; whatſoever his talent be, whether knowledge, wiſedome, or riches: if a man ſhall hoard up riches, let him remember what Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid, when he reproved ſuch; they anſwered, they did no man injury, are they not their owne goods? I, but ſaith he, didſt thou bring them into the world with thee? no ſure, then thou muſt be thankefull; God hath honored men, when he hath given them more then others, but yet hath made them but Stewards: that Steward diſhonoreth his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that keeps that he hath to himſelf, and doth not uſe it, to the benefit of the family: thoſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the juſtice of God, to revenge the quarrell of his mercy, that uſe not his mercies: many men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good things, but they are unthankfull in the uſe of them; as the Prodigall ſonne made an evill uſe of his portion, to the abuſe of his father.</p>
               <p>For the concluſion, they are to uſe every thing three waies: for the glory of God: to the benefit of others: and their owne comfort: three things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable: for if any man, uſe any thing to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, and hurt of his brethren, or of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he is unthankefull: every man ought to returne part of that he hath to God, part of it to the benefit of others: as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Charge them that are rich, that they truſt not in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riches:</hi> on the other ſide, charge them that they doe good, that they be good, and that they be better for their riches: S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> complaineth of ſome, that they were the poorer to God, the richer he was to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102519:93"/>them; every man ought therefore, according as he hath received, to returne due thankefullneſſe againe to God.</p>
               <p>Now we come to ſpeake of the love of God, and the queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the love of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is; it is a communicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, whereby, God loves himſelfe, his ſonne, and his ſpirit, and then his creatures, freely, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually: to explane theſe points; we give love to God as other Attributes, not as qualities, not as accidents, not as any thing comming from God, that was not in him before; becauſe there is nothing in God, that is not in God; Love is given to God, as voide of all imperfection, or error; it is a rule that the Learned have, that whatſover Attribute is given to God, muſt be free from all imperfection, and error, before we can Attribute it to him; and therefore love as it is an Attribute given to God, muſt be purged from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection: there are three things in love: Firſt, a good will, that one bears to another. Secondly, a good worke. Thirdly, a delighting in that which is loved: theſe things are in God, none hath a better will then God, none doth more good then God, and there is none that delights more in his beloved, then God himſelfe: againe, we ſay it is a communicable Attribute, not that love is in God, as it is in man, but becauſe there is ſomething in man, that is like this love of God; man being made partaker of the godly nature; that is, they have this in the quality, that God hath in ſubſtance; and therefore we call it a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102519:93"/>communicable Attribute. In the next place, we ſay, it is that whereby he loves himſelfe, his ſonne, and his ſpirit; it is for his owne glory, that he loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as it appeares, in that the Scripture ſaith, that God is a jealous God, jealous of his worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: if he be jealous, there is a kinde of love of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, goes with it; 2. Commandment; ſo he loves himſelfe, and he loves alſo his ſonne, therefore he is called his <hi>beloved ſonne, Matth.</hi> 3.7. So he loves the ſpirit as proceeding from himſelfe, and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the love whereby the divine nature loves it ſelfe; ſo he loves the creatures, as Angels, and men, and other creatures: that he loves, this appears by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies of Scripture; Angels, and men, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the children of God; Angels, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.6. <hi>Vpon a time the children of God came, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Adam is called the ſon of God, Luke</hi> 3. laſt. Next he loves his creatures freely; the cauſe why he loves them, is in himſelf, not in them; he loves ſome with a ſpeciall love, and ſome with a generall, freely; that appears by the Scriptures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. <hi>Herein is the love of God made manifeſt, that he hath given us his ſonne,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.19. <hi>God loved us firſt; if firſt, then freely;</hi> and no love in us, procured his love; againe he loves them not equally, for he loves men more then other creatures: <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The love he beares to man is manifeſt;</hi> yet further, he loves ſome men more then others; <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>You ſhall be my peculiar people;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, though all the Nations be mine in generall, yet ye ſhall be my chiefe treaſure; <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>A peculiar treaſure;</hi> theſe are as treaſures,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102519:94"/>that men lock up; he loves thoſe that are elected, and thoſe that are called; thoſe that are elected, he loved them when they were enemies; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He loved them before the foundation of the world;</hi> But he loves them better whom he hath called, then thoſe he hath not called: <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me,</hi> thoſe whom he hath endued with his ſpirit: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.8. <hi>The Lord loves the righteous, &amp;c.</hi> To conclude this with that of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> God loves all that he hath made; he loves eſpecially men, and Angels; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, he loves thoſe eſpecially, that are the members of his Sonne; and moſt of all, he loves his Sonne, &amp;c. and ſo wee have made manifeſt this deſcription.</p>
               <p>The next queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is love attributed to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer to this is, becauſe there is none wills better, none works better, acting upon men to make them good, nor delights in them more when they are good: To explane theſe; Firſt, that God is love, it is not an accident, for Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, (let no man underſtand me:) when I ſay God is love, that it is an accident, for then I ſhould ſay there were ſome things in God, that were not God; Againe, there is none wills better: you have heard, there are three things in love, to will good, to doe good, and to delight in good; now none doth this better then God: <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good and perfect gift comes downe from the father of lights, &amp;c.</hi> Finally, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in thoſe that he hath made good: Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſpeaking of this, ſaith; thou lovedſt them, when they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102519:94"/>were not, that thou mighteſt make them to be, when they were; thou madeſt them beautifull, that thou mighteſt delight in them.</p>
               <p>The next Queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you, that God loves himſelfe, and his Sonne, and his ſpirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe they are all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good, they are all one Eſſence, and one will; as the object of the will is good, ſo the object of love is good, and God is love; then no marvell, that he loves himſelfe, his Sonne, and his ſpirit, becauſe they have the ſame Eſſence; every thing loves it ſelfe, and then there is no marvell, as wiſdome ſpeaks, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. <hi>That he was his delight;</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, that the love in the Trinity (which is divine charity,) keeps them together, and unites them in one, and therfore he loves himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it added that he loves his creatures freely?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he made them good; with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall goodneſſe he loves them: Firſt, he loves them, being enemies; he loves them, not for benefit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but for their good; therefore we ſay he loves his creatures freely; each of theſe we will explane: he made all things very good: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. <hi>He looked vpon all that he had made, and behold it was very good:</hi> but it is ſaid, he loves them freely; he loved ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were, before they could poſſibly deſire any thing, therefore freely; he loved ſome when they were his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>When we were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies God ſet forth his love inſending Chriſt to die for us;</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:102519:95"/>as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, God loveth them for their owne benefit, not for his good: God hath no neede of the creature; he created them not for himſelfe, but that he might make them partakers of his owne goodneſſe: and ſo we ſee that God loves them freely without any merit or deſert in them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid, he loves them not equally?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe they are not all alike to him. Some creatures onely, others ſervants onely; ſome children, and among his children, he loves thoſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, better then thoſe that are not called: I ſay, they are not all alike to God: man loves the worke of his owne hands well, but he loves his ſervants better, and his childe beſt of all: if it be ſo with man, much more is it ſo with God; ſome are his creatures, ſome his ſervants, ſome his ſonnes; ſo that he loves them not all alike; ſome are his children, but not begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he loves thoſe with a good will and purpoſe to call them; thoſe that he hath called, he hath juſtified, ſanctified, and hath beſtowed upon them faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and grace; and he delights in theſe, eſpecially that he hath beſtowed his grace upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thus I have laid open the love of God: &amp; now to come to the Uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This teacheth us firſt, that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> gives us to know: he that loves not his brother knowes not God, for God is love: let him boaſt what he will, that he loves God, if he loves not his brother, he is a lyer, he knowes not God to be love; he hath not the experimentall feeling of it; for if he knowes God to be love, he cannot but out of his experimentall knowledge love his brother: ſo the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102519:95"/>Apoſtle ſaith, that man loves not God, that loves not his brother; that is, he hath no experience of the love of God: we may allude to that which is ſaid of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Exod.</hi> 1. that he uſed the people hardly; the reaſon is given, becauſe he knew not <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> for there was another <hi>Pharaoh</hi> riſen, that knew not <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> ſo we may ſay, that many men, becauſe they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God, and the love of God, uſe his children hardly; they are ſcoffers and mockers of thoſe that deſire to love God: certainly theſe men know not the love of God, but they are fed like an Oxe to the ſlaughter: Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath a ſpeech to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Doeſt thou heare the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>God is love?</hi> and dareſt thou ſo goe againſt God, as not love thy brother? for to goe againſt thoſe that are beloved of God, is to goe againſt God; for not to love them in God, and for God, is to denie God: and ſo much for the firſt Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe, Doth God love himſelfe? doth he love his Sonne, and his Spirit? then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his love to us; he makes his love wonderfull, and admirable to be ſeene towards us, becauſe he hath given his Sonne, yea, even the Sonne of his love for us: Then he muſt needs love us, when he ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gave him to death for us. If he had had many ſonnes, it had beene ſomewhat to have given one, hut when he had but one ſonne, even the fonne of his delight; this is wonderfull love: if he had ſent him but to judge the world, it had bin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; but to be a Saviour, and a judge, it is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love: If he had ſent him in happineſſe, and glory,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102519:96"/>&amp;c. but when he empties himſelfe of all honour, and glory, and puts on the forme of a ſervant, and became ſubject to death, even to the death of the croſſe, and became a curſe for us; oh then! how doth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the love of God to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If any ſhould ſay to me, Sir, It ſhould not ſeeme to me by this, that God ſhould love us, becauſe that he gave us his ſonne; is it likely that he can love his enemies, that loves not his ſonne? God did not love his ſonne, for if he had, he would not have given him to death for us; and if he loved not his ſonne, he beares no love to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, He loves his Sonne, even in this, that he gave him a Saviour for us, that he might give more glory to his Sonne; becauſe he dying for us, might have a people purchaſed to himſelfe by his blood. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, this was his glory, that he purchaſed a people, even with his blood. As he was a high Prieſt, he had no people before, but that he might have people, he dyed, &amp;c. Thus the Apoſtle manifeſts, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.4. <hi>That he might redeeme us a peculiar people to himſelfe.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. <hi>Thus it became Chriſt to ſuffer, and to enter into his glory.</hi> And now to end this point, What is his glory, if he had not a people to communicate it too? For the concluſion, This ſhewes the great love of God; therefore let us labour to fill our hearts with the apprehenſion of Gods love, we ſhall then thinke nothing too deare for him: it was ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Now I know that thou loveſt me, becauſe thou haſt not ſpared thy onely ſonne, &amp;c. So God commends his love to us, in that he hath not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102519:96"/>his onely Sonne. The concluſion therefore is, that we ſhould thinke nothing too deare to returne to God againe: if thou haſt any children, or any friends, or ſinne, even thy beſt beloved ſinne, that moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God, and thy ſalvation, ſo ſhalt thou commend thy love to God, and have joy of heart; and God will love thee, and manifeſt his love to thee, and bring thee to glory and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. The next Uſe then, is this, If God loves men, and loves them freely, it hath in it great matter of comfort againſt temptation: when a man doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge himſelfe, and looke into himſelfe, and ſees himſelfe altogether unworthy of love, and wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving hatred, he begins to ſay with himſelfe, he is not beloved of God. To anſwer this objection, that the poore ſoule makes upon this ground. The love of God is moſt free, and from himſelfe, the cauſe is not in man: If the cauſe were in man, the more unworthy, the more diſcomfort: ſhall any man ſay that the fire cannot heat him, becauſe he is cold? or the Sunne hath no heat in it, becauſe he cannot feele it? this hath no ground; ſo, notwithſtanding mans unworthineſſe, he may be beloved, nay, the rather beloved of God, when he feeles his unworthineſſe: as the prodigall Sonne was the fitteſt for his Fathers love, when he found himſelfe unworthy; in like manner, when Gods children finde, and feele themſelves unworthy, ſtill the more unworthy they judge themſelves, the more fit they are for mercy; ſo that this doth not diſcourage a man, but rather incourage him, in the aſſurance of Gods love. I doe not ſay that every man that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102519:97"/>of love, but every man that hath a feeling of his owne unworthineſſe, is more capable of mercy; the Publican that thought himſelfe unworthy, went away more juſtified, then the Phariſee that juſtified himſelfe; God caſts his love upon man that feeles his unworthineſſe; and the more unworthy we feele our ſelves, the more capable we are of love: ſo that if we judge our ſelves, God will not judge us; if any man judge himſelfe unworthy, God will eſteeme him worthy.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why then doth not God love all, ſeeing he loves them for himſelfe: all are unworthy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>There are ſome veſſels of honour, and ſome of diſhonour; what if God, to make his power knowne, &amp;c?</hi> If any man aske, Why will God doe ſo? Why will he ſhew mercy to ſome? &amp;c. The Apoſtle anſwers in the 18. <hi>verſ. Hee will ſhew mercy on whom he will ſhew mercy:</hi> if you aske, Why upon this man, and not upon that? nothing but his Wil is the cauſe: and the Apoſtle ſaith againe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Who art thou that diſputeſt with God?</hi> what art thou that calleſt God to an account? <hi>Aquinas</hi> uſeth this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; A Bricklayer, in building a houſe, hath all his brick out of one mold; and in the building, he layes ſome in the bottome, and ſome on the top; if any aske, Why is this laid in the bottome, and this in the top? the Bricklayer anſwers, There muſt be a foundation, and therefore I lay them. I, but why this brick below, and that on the top? Becauſe it is my will; and if he aske him, Why is it your will? he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102519:97"/>ſhakes him off as a wrangling fellow. So if any aske me, why he ſhewes mercy, &amp;c. becauſe he will ſhew mercy: but why will he? I anſwer ſtill, becauſe he will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. The fourth Uſe, Doth God love man? and doth he love them freely, but not equally? doth he love ſome better then others? Then it admoniſhes, all thoſe that are ſpecially beloved, that they would labour to returne a ſpeciall love againe: his generall love requires a generall love againe; his ſpeciall love a ſpeciall love; every man will challenge this, that God loves him better then others: the Phariſee will challenge this of God; If God doth love him, he muſt returne love againe; nay, every man will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that he loves God with a ſpeciall love; but put this upon the triall: Firſt, if he have a care to keepe the Commandements of God. Secondly, if he ſhew bountifulneſſe. Thirdly, if he be ready to ſuffer for God. For the firſt: If he be carefull to keepe the Commandements of God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hereby we know we love God if we keepe his Commandements:</hi> in which we manifeſt our love to God: every man hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calling, and according to them he hath a double command: he hath a generall calling and a ſpeciall calling; a generall calling, as a Chriſtian; a ſpeciall, in that place and condition of life, in which God hath ſet him: for both theſe he hath Commandments; therefore he muſt labour for this, to be able to keepe the Commands, of his generall calling, but withall, of his ſpeciall calling. For his generall calling, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.10. <hi>He that loves me, keepes my Commandements:</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:102519:98"/>He that loves God, ſets himſelfe to keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and to pleaſe God; for this is that which God is delighted withall, he will have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience before Sacrifices, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.22. Againe, for his ſpeciall calling, there are ſpeciall precepts, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.15. <hi>Simon Peter, loveſt thou me?</hi> If ever thou wilt manifeſt the proofe of thy love to Chriſt, doe the duties of thy ſpeciall calling. Magiſtrates, if they will manifeſt their love to God, they muſt doe the duties of their ſpeciall calling: ſo Maſters, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſo all others: then the concluſion undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, is this, That many men love not God, becauſe they have no care of their ſpeciall calling, and leſſe care of their generall calling. Certainly, thy heart deceives thee, when it tels thee thou loveſt God, when thou haſt no care of thy generall and ſpeciall calling. Secondly, True love is bountifull, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Love is bountifull,</hi> what love ſoever, even ſelfe-love, it is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to the backe, to the belly, to the children, &amp;c. So if a man had this love of God, he would be as bountifull to God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But wherein ſtands this bountifulneſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In three things; in time, in labour, in coſt: for whom men love, to them they are bountifull in time, and labour, and coſt; bountifull in time, they thinke no time too long for them: bountifull in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they thinke no labour too much; bountifull in coſt, they thinke nothing too deare: ſo if any man have a love to God, he will thinke no time too much, no labour too great, nor coſt too deare to beſtow upon his ſervice; but alas brethren! as the people ſay
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102519:98"/>to God, wherein haſt thou loved us? ſo I may ſay to you, who ſay you love God; wherein do you love God? how little time can you afford God? a day in ſeven? and all that is too much; when it is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; it is a wearineſſe to us, it goes againſt the haire; wherein is thy love to God, when thou thinkeſt every houre too much, and tedious in his ſervice?</p>
               <p>Finally, wherein, is thy bountifullneſſe in coſt? but the complaint of the Prophet may be taken up, <hi>Will a man ſpoile his gods? but you have ſpoiled me;</hi> you have robbed God of his due, and yet you ſay, you love God; but alas you deceive your owne hearts, while you erre! &amp;c. Thirdly true love is ſeen, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to ſuffer for God. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>Herein is love, becauſe he hath laid downe his life for us:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to lay downe our lives for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for their ſalvation, rather then that any ſhould fall away, and periſh; if for our brethren, much more ſhould a man doe it for God: the concluſion is thus much; if a man will not ſuffer the loſſe of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing for God; how will he ſuffer the loſſe of his life? &amp;c. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, we ſhould not prefer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing before Chriſt; becauſe he preferred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before us; but hath laid downe his life for us: how doe we love Chriſt againe, when we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a ſcoffe, and a mock for him, when he indured death for us? &amp;c. what will ſuch a man doe, when he ſhall come to loſſe of goods? and if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe this, what will he doe when he ſhall come to the loſſe of life? 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.17. <hi>When Huſhi the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102519:99"/>Archite that was the inward friend of David,</hi> out of policy went back from <hi>David, Abſolom</hi> comes to him with this argument, <hi>Is this thy kindneſſe to thy friend?</hi> ſo may we ſay, is this your love to God? come a little danger, come a little trouble, then you are offended; is this your love to God? whoſoever thou art, thou deceiveſt thy owne heart: therefore he that will manifeſt his love to God, muſt have a care to give him obedience in his generall, and ſpeciall calling, &amp;c. and ſo much for the Attribute of love.</p>

               <p>THE next queſtion is, concerning the Grace of God; there are three Attributes which are the Attributes of Gods goodneſſe; which are love, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and grace; now grace, and mercy, are all one; yet the ſeverall handling of theſe, will afford a great deale of comfort: and therefore to ſpeak, of the grace of God, I have made choice of this text, wherein, I have taken liberty, not to ſhew you the coherence, &amp;c. Now of this graee, the Scripture ſpeakes two waies: Grace as it is in the favourite, or as it is in the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102519:99"/>favourer; and heer we are to underſtand it, grace in him that ſhewes grace; that we may know what this grace is, we muſt conſider it two waies; it is either generall, or ſpeciall, called ſaving grace, which is that, we are to ſpeake of, and ſo the queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the grace of God, or of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is a communicable Attribute, whereby he ſpecially favours ſome; in this ſome, though unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of themſelves, bringing them to ſalvation; here in this deſcription, are divers parts, we ſhall explane them as breifely as we can: The firſt is this: grace, or the ſaving grace of God, contains 2. things; the one as the cauſe, the other as the effects; the firſt is the free favour of God, to the Elect; the ſecond, the gifts of grace, or meanes of ſalvation, which doe flow out of this: to ſhew each of theſe; firſt, grace ſignifies the free favour of God: <hi>We are ſaved by grace, Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>we are juſtified freely by grace &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, grace is taken for thoſe gifts of grace that are beſtowed upon men, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. when they had ſeene the grace of God: that is, when they had ſeene the gifts; for ſo the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. Every one have received grace, according to the meaſure in Chriſt; and ſo the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. Let every man that hath received grace, as faithfull diſpoſers, &amp;c. This grace we ſpeake of, is to be underſtood of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and not the later, becauſe it is the grace in God, and not that grace which is from God, in man; againe we ſay, it is a communicable Attribute, the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102519:100"/>reaſon is, not becauſe this grace is communicated to any man, (that is to ſay) that it is in man in the ſame manner as it is in God, but becauſe there is ſomething in man, in a proportion like this, therefore we call it a communicable Attribute: the next thing is this, we ſay, it is that whereby he loves ſome in his ſon, we do not ſay all; it is not univerſall grace, it is univerſall of all ſorts of men, but not of every particular man, and therefore we ſay he loves ſome: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>We are juſtified freely by grace,</hi> but this grace is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, therefore in the 28. verſe he ſaith, <hi>We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a man is juſtified by faith:</hi> now this faith is the faith of the elect: <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. againe he loves ſome in his ſonne, that is manifeſt by, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.6. <hi>We are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the glory of his grace in Chriſt:</hi> againe, unworthy in themſelves: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>It is ſaid we are called with an holy calling, not according to our works, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his purpoſe and grace:</hi> againe he loves them freely; or els grace ſhould be no grace: as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, grace is no grace, if it be not every way free; and therefore it hath the name of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is given freely unto man: againe, he loved ſome in his ſonne, bringing them to ſalvation, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Eternall life is the gift of God;</hi> we are ſaved freely by grace: faith is the inſtrument, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation unto all men hath appeared:</hi> therefore that, that brings a man to ſalvation, is grace: ſo we have ſeen the ſeverall parts of this deſcription opened.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is ſaving grace attributed to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it is no created gift in the ſoule of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102519:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>man, but the uncreated grace of God, who favoureth and accepteth, according to his owne will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: To explane this, it is no created thing in man: <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The grace of God which brings ſalvation to all men.</hi> What grace? The Apoſtle explanes, in the third Chapter and 4. verſe, that when that bountifull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that love of God to man, did appear; what? to ſave man by workes? he anſwers no, not by works of righteouſneſſe, which we have done, but by grace we are ſaved: yet further, it is manifeſt, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes after this manner, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>We are called with a holy calling, not according to works, but according to his purpoſe and grace,</hi> which God hath before the world was; was it before the world? then it could not be in man: that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24.28 <hi>We are juſtified by grace;</hi> if that be too little, he ſaith we are <hi>juſtified freely by grace;</hi> not for the grace that is in us, becauſe that is but the effect of grace in God; if it were for any ſuch thing, it were not free, but it is free, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We ſee then, we are ſaved by grace, and this muſt be grace in God, through faith: therefore it is not for the grace of faith, but of grace beſides faith, not of our ſelves; if for grace in our ſelves, then the Apoſtle would have ſaid ſo; but he ſaith, not of our ſelves that no man might boaſt: the Phariſie, boaſted of himſelfe, and his goodneſſe, but he was not juſtified; there is nothing in man to boaſt of, therefore it is manifeſt, that it is an uncreated grace, by which we are ſaved: I ſhut up this point thus: this grace is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively in God, and objectively in man; becauſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102519:101"/>the minde of man is enlightned by faith, and findes ſweet comfort in God: therfore we call it the uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated grace in God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you that he favoureth ſome unworthy in themſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe that few only are elected, and they freely elected, and this is the grace of election; to prove this: <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Many are called but few are choſen;</hi> A little to preſſe this place, I doe not ſay all, and that calling is but an externall calling, not the internall calling; for how many thouſands are there that never heard the ſound of the Goſpell: then if there be many not called outwardly, then are there but few choſen; why? becauſe thoſe that are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly called, are but a handfull, in compariſon of the world, and yet but few of them choſen: yet further, the very word election ſhewes there is a chuſeing; for to elect, is to chuſe ſome out of many, you have election in your companies, of Maſters and Wardens; now all are not Maſters: but election is the choyce of ſome out of many to that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of veſſels of honour, and diſhonour; there he ſhewes there is not election of all; nay further, ſome are not prepared for glory, &amp;c. and take alſo that ſame place, 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 2.8. they ſtumble at Chriſt for which thing they were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, therefore not elected, and therefore election, is but of few; Againe, election is free, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. according to grace, for Chriſt was freely choſen to be the Sonne of God: (according to his humanity) to be the head of the Church, to be the honoured
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102519:101"/>of men and Angels; <hi>Auguſtine</hi> infers upon this, every faithfull man that will truely underſtand election and reprobation, let him looke upon Chriſt and he ſhall ſee himſelfe; he was freely choſen to be the Sonne of God, and therefore freely choſen, not for foreſeen works, but by grace: for ſo the Apoſtle calls it <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. if election be by grace, and but to a few, then the ſaving grace is but to a few.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But why ſay you he brings them to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe that grace is the beginning both of ſalvation, and all meanes tending to ſalvation: but this queſtion ſhall be handled more at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt uſe: If this be the ſaveing grace of God, &amp;c. then whoſoever hath beene once truly aſſured that he is Gods, that he is in the eſtate of election, its poſſible he may be alway aſſured of it; if a man be but once in all his life perſwaded that he is in the eſtate of grace, he may attaine to the ſame aſſurance of his ſalvation after, becauſe this grace is in God: There is a greater certainty of faith, then of ſence, becauſe faith by the grace of God aſſures a man of his ſalvation, and this grace is in God firm, immutable, and unchangeable; beſides a man may be certain by faith, though not by ſence; one place for many, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>It is by faith, that it might be of grace; to the end that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeede;</hi> marke how the Apoſtle teaches us to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; undoubtedly, the promiſe is ſure: why? becauſe it is by grace, and grace is ſure; and if the promiſe be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102519:102"/>ſure, my faith is ſure; ſo that here is the comfort, here is the certainty of our faith, in a flat oppoſition to works; then if our doubting hearts tell us that we are not the Lords, we are to preſume upon the grace of God: And if this be preſumption as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith; I will preſume: And therefore here is our comfort, and ſtay, againſt all troubles whatſoever they be: Againe, it is ſaid that this grace, it is his Sonne: what of this? not that he will make his promiſe more firme in it ſelfe, but to make our faith more firme in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending it: why? becauſe the ground of this aſſurance is, that God cannot, nor will not, ceaſe to favour his Sonne; ſo neither will he ceaſe to favour, thoſe that he loves in his Sonne: but as the favour of God, did never leave Chriſt, till he had brought him to glory, ſo undoubtedly, he wil never leave thoſe that he loves in Chriſt; for if he dealt thus with his naturall body, he will deale thus with his myſticall body; certainely hee will bring the myſticall body, where he hath brought the naturall body; for Chriſt hath prayed, Father, I will that they ſhould be where I am; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely if he hath brought Chriſt to that glory, he will bring his myſticall body to it: why? becauſe he hath taken poſſeſſion of it, in our nature; and therefore, out of that love that God beares to them that are in Chriſt, he wil doe it: and as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, that our nature, hath taken poſſeſſion of heaven already; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that denies thee, that art a member of Chriſt that thou ſhalt be in heaven, he denies Chriſt to be in heaven; But every man that would be prataker of the glory, muſt labour to make his election ſure, becauſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102519:102"/>there are but ſome that ſhall be partakers of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: let every man labour to ſee whether he be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and called; that ſo he may know whether he be in the ſtate of ſalvation. And theſe be the degrees, as the Apoſtle layes them downe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Calling, ſanctification, and ſo proceeding in that order, that the Apoſtle layes downe there: every man muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have the feeling of his calling, his ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his juſtification, &amp;c. that the guilt of ſinne is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, &amp;c. Thus every man ſhould labour to make his calling and election ſure, ſo he may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his ſalvation, even then when God takes away his feeling of it: whoſoever he is that doth labour to have theſe tokens, he hath this comfort in this life, that he is the Lords; and in the life to come he ſhall have glory and happineſſe for ever.</p>

               <p>THe laſt part of the deſcription of Grace is, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to ſalvation. To explane this, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound two Queſtions; the anſwering and opening of which, will explane the point: The firſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it further added in the deſcription of grace, bringing men to ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe Grace is the chiefeſt motive, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102519:103"/>the firſt beginning of ſalvation, and all the meanes that tend thereunto.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What are the meanes that bring men to ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are either externall, as the preaching of the Goſpell, and ſending Chriſt to ſuffer; or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as vocation, juſtification, ſanctification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that grace, which is the chiefeſt motive, and firſt beginning of ſalvation, and the meanes tending to it, do ſhew, that our ſalvation is of faith; becauſe the beginning of ſalvation is without our ſelves; in God, ſhewing mercy, wherein we are meere patients, howſoever we come to aſſent. And that this is the firſt and chiefeſt principle, and firſt beginning of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we confirme: Why? becauſe it is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of election, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God is ſure; the Lord knowes who are his:</hi> there is election, and the foundation, is the grace of God. Election is of grace, you heard it proved before; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. that it is the free grace of God. Againe, the grace of God, is the firſt and chiefeſt principall cauſe, of the meanes by which we are brought to ſalvation: the meanes you heard were of two ſorts, externall, and internall; externall, were the preaching of the Word, and the ſending Chriſt to ſuffer: the former of theſe, is meerely of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. <hi>We have received grace, and Apoſtleſhip &amp;c.</hi> that is, as if he ſhould ſay, that all the meanes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are of grace: and ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, I am the leaſt of all the Saints, yet have found grace. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſending his Sonne to ſuffer, is meerely of grace,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102519:103"/>1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, &amp;c.</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle affirmes manifeſtly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. So that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall meanes are meerely of grace. The internall meanes alſo are of grace: and the firſt of theſe is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and this is of grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>We are called with a holy calling, according to his purpoſe, and grace:</hi> So that we ſee, that this is of grace: and indeede, whom did ever the Lord call, that was not at the ſame time worthy of condemnation? This we ſee the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes cleare, that before his calling he walked ſo, that no man could ſay, black was his eye; yet for all his civill, honeſt life, he confeſſeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he was worthy of condemnation; and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath a Meditation upon this, he caſt him down a perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> and raiſed him up a <hi>Paul.</hi> I adde to this, that this calling of God is to little purpoſe, unleſſe that man aſſent: but to have power to aſſent, is not of man, but of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. God works in a moment upon our will, which is unwilling at the firſt; and therefore of grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes to bring us to ſalvation, is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; and that is meerely of grace: ſo you have heard, that juſtification is of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2, 4. We are juſtified freely by grace, not of our ſelves, not of workes, but of grace: Why? becauſe there were no works before juſtification: for then men begin to do good workes, when they are juſtified. If juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be by workes, then they muſt goe before juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but they follow after it, as Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, workes come after we are juſtified; for (ſaith he) an evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit; &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:102519:104"/>
               <p>The third meanes is ſanctification; and that is of the free grace of God: and this is manifeſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4. We are ſaved by grace, not of our works, but through the renewing of the holy Ghoſt: we are ſaved by ſanctification; How comes that? by the work of the ſpirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. God loves his Church, and out of that love comes their ſanctification, that he might ſanctifie; he waſhes it, ſo that it appeares: this alſo is of grace. Graces in man, are but the gifts of grace, and the fruits of the ſpirit: this appeares, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>We are Gods work manſhip, created unto good workes.</hi> So alſo <hi>Eze.</hi> 36.37. he promiſes, that he will ſend his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fourth meanes is perſeverance: and this is a ſpeciall meanes to keepe us to enter into ſalvation; and this alſo is of grace, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my feare in their hearts, and they ſhall never depart from me.</hi> So there we ſee, that all the meanes tending to ſalvation, are of grace: the whole maſſe of our corruptions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be condemned; and whoſoever is called out of it, is called freely of grace: ſo that ſalvation, and all the meanes tending thereunto, are of grace. And thus we have explaned, and proved the Queſtion; and ſo now you have the whol explication of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The Uſes are, firſt, againſt thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that teach a double grace: there is grace (ſay they) that God freely gives. Secondly, grace that makes us gracious to God. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, This is not the grace of God, which is in himſelfe, but a created grace in man; as faith, love, and hope: this is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102519:104"/>falſe: for we have ſhewed, the grace of God, which brings us to ſalvation, is that which is ſeated in God, and not in man: this is apparant in I know not how many places. The Apoſtle when he ſpeakes of grace, makes oppoſition betweene it and workes: Why ſo? that he might exclude all workes, both externall, and internall, and whatſoever may be tearmed by the name of workes. So that we ſee that the Papiſts doe erre; for in all the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> if he had meant inherent graces, he would have named them: but he ſaith, we are ſaved by grace, as ſpeaking of one, but never doth he ſpeake, in all the Scripture, that we are ſaved by graces, but by grace. I conclude, It is a ſenceleſſe thing to ſay, that a created grace in us, ſhould deſerve ſupernaturall glory; and to ſay, a defiled grace (for ſo it is as it comes from us) ſhould deſerve undefiled glory: therefore we ſee the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe, is againſt the Pelagians: They tell us, firſt, that God created all to glory, when they had fallen from God by ſinne, he elected them all to glory againe; and he ſent his Sonne to redeeme them all; and hath given to all ſufficient, nay, effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent graee, whereby all may be ſaved: and there be ſome of us which too much bend this way, which ſome of you love well: this by the way. <q>All theſe are falſe, and full of blaſphemy. Firſt, That God created all to glory at firſt, is falſe: for they make election follow after creation: God did not create all to glory: Why? the Scripture is manifeſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. there are veſſels of honour, prepared for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102519:105"/>and veſſels of diſhonour, prepared for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt, the Apoſtle ſpeakes there of things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created: it was not upon a ſecond thought, that God ordained ſome to honour, and others to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Againe, this poſition of theirs; is againſt the power of God, againſt the wiſdome, and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of God. What? did God create all to be ſaved? why then are they not ſaved? Is God fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of his end? it muſt be, either becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or becauſe he will not; and to ſay either of theſe, is not farre from blaſphemy. The Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver willed any thing abſolutely, but he did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it: if he did in the creation of man appoint all to glory, why are they not all ſaved? There is a damnable Booke which hath bin written of late, ſhewing that all ſhall be ſaved. For the concluſion of this: If God created all to glory, Why is this man glorified, and not that? Is it from the will of man? or from the will of God? who puts the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? It muſt be man: but of this, when we come to it: but now we ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he hath prepared ſome to honour, and others to diſhonour: and therefore it is needleſſe for me to ſtand longer upon this.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The next thing that they hold, is, that there is a univerſall election: Concerning this, it is falſe: Why? you heard the reaſon before: but we will adde a little more now. Certainly, there can be no univerſall election; for where all are choſen, there can be no election: election is the chooſing of ſome out of many; if ſo, then all cannot be choſen. Again,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102519:105"/>if God did chuſe all, Why then are not all ſaved? If there be an election of all, then the election of God doth determine nothing: who then? men, and ſo men are made the cauſe of their owne glory: and there be ſome (which meane well) ſay, that God hath elected all to ſalvation, if they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, where the election of God is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall; depending upon the will of man. In this caſe who is it that determines election? none but man, and therefore they ſay, Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſtands thus: I beleeve, therefore I am elected; thus they teach, if any man will beleeve, God hath elected him, he is elected; this is to make man determine, his owne election: Beſides, if Gods election be conditionall; then it ſhewes, that God before the foundation of the world, could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine no thing: hath God elected all? why, are not all ſaved? hath men fruſtrated God of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? is the divell ſtrong enough, to pluck any man out of Gods hands? therefore &amp;c. Againe, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection univerſall; then we conclude, there is a u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall reprobation: but to ſay ſo, they account it odious; but there cannot be univerſall election, unleſſe there alſo be univerſall reprobation: there are many things that might be ſaid concerning this point, but it is ſo abſurd, that I will not ſtand any longer upon it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>They further ſay, that Chriſt hath redeemed all by his ſatisfaction: I anſwer to this, that it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious as before: we would offend no man, but thoſe that are of that minde, do too much helpe forward
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102519:106"/>the Arminian hereſie: indeed the Scripture ſaith, that Chriſt hath redeemed all; but the Scripture tells us againe, that it is all ſorts, not every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man; but let us heare them reaſon: Redeemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſay they, appertaines to the Church: now the Church is Catholique; we anſwer, are all men, (that is every ſingular man) that are in the Church, ſaved? no, yet ſalvation belongs to the Church, and in it ſome Kings, and Princes, and of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ſorts of men, are ſaved, as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſome, not many mighty &amp;c. Againe, Chriſts death (ſaith ſome) is ſufficient for all, but all do not receive it: Theſe being Divines, I am very loath to oppoſe them: ſufficient for all, becauſe they ſay, Chriſts death was infinite: ſaving their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I cannot ſee it, this is that I ſay: to ſay that Chriſts death is ſufficient, either in the intent of God, for all men, or that he ſent his ſonne to die for all men, and that Chriſt in their perſon did die, and gave himſelf for them: I hold to be falſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would have them ſpeake more ſparingly of this; that it was never the intent of God, I make it manifeſt, it cannot ſtand with the wiſedome of God, to ſend his ſonne to die for thoſe whom he had determined ſhould periſh; he had made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobation, and ſo to deſtruction: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. when God had ordained ſome to deſtruction, would he ſend his ſonne to die for them? 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. It is ſaid that Chriſt was ſet, <hi>A ſtone to ſtumble at, and a rocke of offence &amp;c.</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, they were ordained of old, to this condemnation;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102519:106"/>and is it likely that God would ſend his ſonne to die for them? this cannot ſtand with common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Againe, to ſay that Chriſt had an intent to ſave all, by giving himſelfe to death, is abſurd, in as much as he knew who were to periſh: would Chriſt give himſelfe to death, for thoſe that were to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? this ſtands not with the wiſedome of Chriſt. Chriſt knew the children of perdition; Chriſt knew that <hi>Iudas</hi> was the ſonne of perdition: if theſe then were children of perdition, Chriſt never died for them, and therefore he died not for all: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>I have choſen you</hi> 12. <hi>and one of you is a divell:</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> well expounds that place; he choſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven by mercy, and the twelfe by judgement; he choſe the eleven, that he might be the inſtrument to powre out the bloud of Chriſt: ſo that it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by all this, that Chriſt died not for all. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I may not ſtand upon this, if Chriſt died for all, why have they not all the benefit of his death? why? you will ſay, becauſe they will not beleeve: then if they would beleeve they might? but whence comes this will? not from man, for none could beleeve, unleſſe they were ordained to it; but what is this but to make man the cauſe of his owne ſalvation? I pray you, why was <hi>Peter</hi> ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and <hi>Iudas</hi> wicked? you will ſay, becauſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> beleeved, and <hi>Iudas</hi> did not: but I aske againe, who put the difference? not man, I am ſure, but God: did Chriſt redeem all? then how are not all partakers of his redemption? &amp;c. can any man pull them out of his hand? he ſaith, no man was able to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102519:107"/>pull them out of his hand: he ſaith, he had loſt none: if the Father had elected them, and the Son redeemed them, how ſhould they periſh? finally, did God redeem all? why then is any man puniſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally? is God unjuſt? God forbid: you do ſpeak after the manner of men: if Chriſt had redeemed all, God could not in juſtice have puniſhed any: but God doth juſtly lay torments upon ſome, caſting them into hell; therefore Chriſt never paid the price for all: Thoſe whom Chriſt redeemed, he ſanctified; the Scriptures is apparant, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>He hath redeemed them, that he might ſanctifie them:</hi> whereupon I argue, that Chriſt hath redeemed no more, then he hath ſanctified; now how many millions have bin in the world, that were never ſanctified? but thoſe that Chriſt died for, thoſe he ſanctified; certainly, let Divines ſay what they will, that the death of Chriſt was ſufficient in the value, &amp;c.</q> we are ſure that it is not ſufficient, in the intent, and purpoſe of God. As for example, a great Prince dies, and gives a great legacy to redeem Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, not all but ſome, thus and thus qualified: now if a man ſhould come to the Priſon, and tell them this news; this would be a great comfort for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives indeed, but yet onely to ſome, (ſo and ſo qualified) not to all: certainly the Scripture tels us, that Chriſt gave himſelfe for his ſheep, and for his friends; unleſſe thou be ſome one of theſe, Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave himſelfe for thee: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, this is the property of redemption; in thoſe that are in the Church, the ſtrong man is caſt out of them, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102519:107"/>they are made the children of grace: and therefore it is an idle thing, that ſome go up and down and ſay, that Chriſt died for all; if they wil but believe that Chriſt died for them: Brethren theſe things that I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; I have thought of, therefore beware of ſuch men, they make way for them that ſay every man may be ſaved, and ſuch are the Pelagians &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. To our ſelves, the comfort was, you heard, grounded upon that of the Apoſtle, that it muſt be of grace &amp;c. So that heer is certainty of ſalvation; if God ſhould leave a man in diſſertion all his life time, yet the promiſe is ſure, there is his comfort grounded upon the grace of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. This ſhould be a provocation of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to every man, that hath at any time had an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſalvation, to himſelfe; by his calling, by his juſtification, and ſanctification: why? becauſe God hath put a difference between him, and others: if the glory of this appertaine to God, then it muſt not be placed upon our wills, but on his free grace: this is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.6. <hi>To the glory of his grace hath he choſen us.</hi> Beloved, if it be to the glory, and praiſe of his grace it muſt be free, or elſe grace is no grace; as you heard, that men might not boaſt, but might glorifie God: therefore doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over other men, but pitty men, that have not the ſame meaſure of ſaving grace, and give God the glory, and all too little for him: Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, bleſſed be God, that when we could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by workes, provided, we ſhould be ſaved by grace: bleſſed be God, that hath made a ſeparation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102519:108"/>between us, and others; we ought to be thankfull. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath this queſtion, why are ſome ſaved? why are not all ſaved? becauſe God is a juſt Judge to the one, and a mercifull Father to the other: all this is to the praiſe of the glory of his grace: be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unthankfull; but let him be thankfull that hath, for he hath cauſe to acknowledge this, that he hath left others in their condemnation, and hath made choice of him; therefore whoſoever hath the feeling of theſe things tending to ſalvation, &amp;c. let him bleſſe God, that hath begun them, he will perfect them &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THE laſt Attribute of the divine Eſſence, that we ſpake of, was the Grace of God: the next At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute is Mercy, of which we muſt ſay as we ſaid of Grace, that it is all one with the love of God, but yet the divers handling of it apart, from the other, adminiſters unto us good inſtruction: now to ſpeake of this, and follow the ſame order we have done, the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102519:108"/>words commend unto us, the mercy of God; and therefore according to our order, the firſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the mercy of God, or of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a communicable Attribute, whereby he freely, and willingly helpeth, ſuccoureth, and aſſiſteth his creatures in all their miſery; though ſome, eſpecially more then others: To open every part of Gods mercy, it is attributed to God; not as it is in man, but as other affections, according, and after the manner of men, are given to God, ſo alſo is this; that which is imperfect, and joined with error in man, is not ſo, when we attribute it to God: the mercy that we attribute to God, is the ſame in ſubſtance, though freed from the corruption that is in man: The Stoicks doe define mercy after this manner; they ſay it is a griefe of heart, ariſing from other mens evills, which we think, or apprehend, they unjuſtly ſuffer; but in this manner it cannot be Attributed to God; yet freed from the imperfection, and paſſion, and then it may; for he being the chiefeſt good, and goodneſſe it ſelfe, can have nothing in him, but that which is good, and moſt perfect: in man, mercy is with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and error; and ſo we may not Attribute it to God: but firſt we muſt free it from imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the proofe of this, that God is mercifull; we need not ſtand long, <hi>Exo.</hi> 20.2. <hi>He will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thouſands. Pſal.</hi> 103.8. <hi>The Lord is mercifull and gracious. Lamen.</hi> 3.2. <hi>It is the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed.</hi> In the next place, mercy of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102519:109"/>divine Eſſence is a communicable attribute, becauſe men have a kinde of mercy in proportion, anſwerable to it. The next followes: I ſay, it is that by which he doth freely ſuccour his creatures, freely. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, <hi>I will haue mercy, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 9.18. he doth it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and freely. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.5. <hi>The Lord is gord, and his mercy endures for ever, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, his mercy, as it is in the latine word, is <hi>Miſericordia;</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two words, <hi>miſeria</hi> and <hi>cordis,</hi> and then Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> will have it thus; the miſery of a man conceived by others, moves mercy in the heart of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Againe, he is mercifull to ſome more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; there is a double mercy, a generall, and a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: A generall mercy, is that by which God is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and doth helpe all his creatures; beſides expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the Word manifeſts the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.27. <hi>All things wait upon thee:</hi> and 147. <hi>Pſalme. Thou fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt them, and thou giveſt them food;</hi> yea, <hi>the Ravens that cry, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 6.15. <hi>Be you mercifull, as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father;</hi> how is that? it hangs upon the 35. <hi>verſe, for he is kinde unto the unkinde, and to the evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpeciall mercy is that which is ſhewed more ſpecially to ſome; it is not onely a temporall mercy, but alſo a ſpirituall: for he ſhewes mercy more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſome, to thoſe that are his owne, not onely in temporall, but alſo in ſpirituall things: as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. <hi>ſhew mercy to thouſands:</hi> as a father pittyeth his ſonne, ſo doth the Lord them that feare him, <hi>Pſal</hi> 103.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7. God offers himſelfe, as a father. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I was a blaſphemer, &amp;c. but I
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102519:109"/>found mercy. Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>I will have mercy, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo I have briefly explaned the meaning of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is mercy thus attributed to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe mercy in him is naturall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Firſt, it is naturall, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. he is called the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercy; and Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, Why the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercy? becauſe it is himſelfe: it is his nature to ſhew mercy, and this mercy is eternall; for as God is eternall, and hath no beginning, and no ending, ſo is his mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy endures, &amp;c.</hi> It was not firſt in man, and then in God; but firſt in God, and then in man; and ſo communicated to man, as other graces: he is the father of mercy; therefore it is firſt in himſelfe, and men are perſwaded to imitate him, as you heard in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>be ye mercifull, as your heavenly father is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> here is the difference, mercy in God, is the will of God; mercy in man, is in the will of man, but joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with paſſion, and griefe; in which particular it differs from the mercy of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it added, that he willingly, and freely aſsiſteth all his creatures in their miſeries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is this, becauſe his mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from his goodneſſe; his goodneſſe cauſeth love, and love cauſeth mercy. To open this: Mercy is not goodneſſe in him that obtaineth mercy, but in him that ſheweth mercy: man hath need of mercy, but he deſerves none, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>Prayſe the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy, &amp;c.</hi> God is rich in mercy, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4, 5. Why? becauſe he hath freely loved us:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102519:110"/>whereſoever there is love in any, either men or beaſt, there is alwayes pitty; for ſuch as their love is, ſuch is their pitty: then undoubtedly, as there is love in God to all his creatures, ſo his mercy is to all his creatures: but his ſpeciall love to man, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. When the bountifulneſſe, and goodneſſe of Gods love to man appeared, &amp;c. So that goodneſſe breeds love; love, mercy: and this goes back againe; for mercy argues love, and love goodneſſe. The love that is in God is double; one is naturall, the other is voluntary. The naturall love is betweene the Trinity, the Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sonne, the Sonne the Father, and the Spirit loving them both: ſo that theſe cannot but love after this ſort: God cannot but love himſelfe; and there is a voluntary love, which God may change if he will; but for that he hath bound himſelfe by promiſe, he will not change it: and this is that with which he loves his creatures.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why conclude you, that he doth ſpecially ſhew mercy to ſome, rather then to other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe mercy is from his free love: he loves ſome more then others, therefore he ſhewes mercy to ſome more then others: it is very naturall to God to ſhew mercy; and where we love moſt, there we labour to ſhew moſt mercy: therefore we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to helpe our children, and friends in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. God loves all his creatures, yea, he loves the wicked, but yet ſpecially his owne: he is mercifull to the wicked, but he is much more mercifull to his owne. To expreſſe this: He is mercifull to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in one thing; but he is mercifull to the godly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102519:110"/>in many things; he ſhewes mercy to the wicked in their puniſhments, but he ſhewes mercy to the godly, both in their puniſhments, and ſinnes: we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe indeede he doth ſhew mercy to the wicked in their ſinnes, in being patient towards them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. He is mercifull to them in ſuffering them to enjoy many outward bleſſings, that they are unworthy of; nay, he is mercifull to them, when he layeth any evill upon them; he never layes ſo much as they deſerve (as good Divines thinke) no not in hell: ſo that he is mercifull to them. To his owne he ſhewes mercy, both in their puniſhments and ſinnes: in their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2. <hi>the Lord in wrath remembreth mercy, Lam.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Though he afflict for a while, yet he will not forſake for ever:</hi> ſo that ſame <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7. <hi>If we endure chaſtiſing, he offers himſelfe as a father:</hi> he deales mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully with his owne, as a father to his children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13.</p>
               <p>There is a ſpeciall mercy that the Lord ſhewes to his owne, in reſpect of their ſinnes: in reſpect of the guilt of ſinne, the infirmity of ſinne, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne. Firſt, in reſpect of the guilt of ſinne, he is mercifull in pardoning of it. In reſpect of the corruption of ſinne, in the purging of it. in reſpect of the puniſhment of ſinne, in proportioning of it. That God is mercifull in all theſe, is proved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. He pardons iniquity, heales infirmity, deales not with us after our ſinnes: <hi>as farre as the heaven is above the earth, ſo great is his mercy toward them that feare him:</hi> wherein ſtands the greatneſſe of his mercy? in taking away the guilt, power, and puniſhment of ſinne, <hi>Iſai</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:102519:111"/>43.25. <hi>I am he that forgiveth ſinnes.</hi> So <hi>Micah</hi> 7.8. <hi>Who hath a God like to our God? who forgiveth ſinne, and paſſeth by the iniquity of the remnant.</hi> This is ſuch a God, as there is none like him. And thus we ſee there is a ſpeciall mercy to the godly, which the Lord ſhewes to them, both in their puniſhments, and ſinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe teacheth us, with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, with what aſſurance men may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their miſeries, ſeeking unto God. They goe to him that is the father of mercies, the fountaine of mercies: if any man have any mercy, it ſprings from this fountaine; ſo that then we may with great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance flye to God for mercy: may the poore flye to the rich? may any man flye when he is in miſery to another for ſuccour? may a childe flye to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? then undoubtedly we may flye to God: if there be ſuch refreſhing water to be had from men, what is there then in the fountaine of mercy? if a childe come to his father complaining of his miſeries, and make knowne his wants, he preſently pitties him, and by a naturall inſtinct ſhewes mercy to his childe: ſhal not the Lord doe it much more? and therefore we neede not goe doubtingly, as the heathen King did, that knew not whether God would be mercifull or no, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.9. (<hi>who can tell,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whether God will repent</hi>) but being better informed, and better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, may goe with aſſurance, becauſe we know that God is mercifull. No man that is a cold will go doubtingly to the fire, ſaying, it may be the fire will warme me, but he knowes it will: ſo no man doubts
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102519:111"/>whether the ſunne will heate, becauſe it is the nature of fire to warme, and the ſunne to heat; ſo men need not to goe to God doubtingly, becauſe it is the nature of God to ſhew mercy.</p>
               <p>Indeed there may be ſome things, that may put ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtackles, between us, and the fire, and ſo may keepe away the heat; and ſo ſome ſinnes, may ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and Gods mercy; but if theſe be not, we may go to God with aſſurance: who is he that hath felt the mercy of God? and hath had the experience of Gods mercy? that will not ſtill depend upon it? he that findes the benefit of the fire, he needs not go doubtingly to the fire; he that hath the experience of Gods mercy, every day he may goe with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be heard: the ſervants of <hi>Aram,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 20.31. <hi>We heard that the Kings of Iſrael were mercifull Kings:</hi> but we need not ſay ſo; but every one that hath conſcience to walke with God, may ſay, we know that God is mercifull: for the concluſion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ought to labour, that he may be fitted for mercy; let him lay no obſtacles in the way; that ſame is true, that Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, upon 33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. If we die, we may blame our ſelves; we cannot ſay but God hath ſhewed us the way, and meanes, to avoid deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe: doth God ſhew ſpeciall mercy to ſome, and thoſe his elect? then by this a man may know, whether he appertaines to God, or no; becauſe if he have the ſpeciall mercy of God, it is that which he beſtowes upon none but his elect.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:102519:112"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſome will aske, wherin conſiſts the ſpeciall mercy of God, to his?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer; many waies God ſhewes ſpeciall mercy: Firſt, in this, that when a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be condemned, the Lord ſends temporall afflictions that he might prevent his condemnation: and this is a ſpeciall mercy, that God will by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall evill, deliver men from an eternall: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>When we are chaſtized, we are chaſtized in this world, that we might not be condemned in the world to come:</hi> as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks; if God lay his hand upon his, it is not the execution of his revenge, but the working of forgivenes of ſinnes, therefore it is a ſpeciall mercy; we will leave the examination of this, to every mans conſcience. Secondly, it is a ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, in that he layes no more upon them then they are able to beare: This is manifeſt 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. God is faithfull, that will lay no more upon you, then you are able to beare: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.14. <hi>He conſiders whereof we are made;</hi> a ſpeciall mercy that God ſhewes unto his, to remember their infirmities; ſo that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>As the ſuffering of Chriſt abounded, ſo our comfort abounded through Chriſt;</hi> where he would not lay greater afflictions, upon them, then they were able to beare, but yet ſuch afflictions, as they ſhould be able to endure, and that either by leſning their afflictions, or elſe by ſtrengthening them in them, and ſo this alſo is a ſpeciall mercy of God. Thirdly, it is a ſpeciall mercy of God, that he makes afflictions a meanes to purge and to break off ſinne: Thus the Lord dealt with his Church, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 2.6. <hi>I
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102519:112"/>hedge up the way with thornes,</hi> that when they were reſolved to goe on in ſinne, yet he would keepe them from it; ſo the Apoſtle obtained this mercy, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. he received the meſſenger of Sathan to buffet him, a prick in the fleſh, a ſpeciall mercy of God, that he gave him a ſharpe affliction, to keepe him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lift up: <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.13. The blewnes of the wound ſerves to purge folly; afflictions are like fire to the golden Ore, or the Iron, which purgeth the dros from the gold, and the ruſt from the Iron; afflictions are like the winde, which ſeparate the chaffe from the Corn; or like the pruning knife that cuts off the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable branches, by afflictions, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, their corruptions are leſſned; ſo that by this we may ſee the ſpeciall mercy of God. Fourthly, God exerciſeth his ſpeciall mercy, when he ſeemes to be moſt angry, as Parents doe when they forbid their children, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Table, ſomtime laying Rods upon them, and yet they are in that good unto them; ſo it is with God, not only when we know him kind unto us, but then alſo when he ſeemes angry with us: Afflictions are made profitable when God gives grace to profit by them; this is a ſpeciall mercy, becauſe a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it by nature; as Phyſick will not profit a man, except he have nature to worke upon it, no more will afflictions without the grace of God: afflictions are ordained of God to profit his, but afflictions of themſelves profit not, but when they bring humility, as in the Prodigall Sonne; this is a ſpeciall favour, when they breed holineſſe in men, this is a ſpeciall mercy; holineſſe is of two ſorts; there is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102519:113"/>holines, or internall; this is inward ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; externallis without, whereſoever afflictions works: The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. ſhewes that God offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a father; what to doe? to make us partakers of his holineſſe; not that afflictions can doe this, but God by an eſpeciall mercy doth make them doe it; as Chriſt himſelfe though he were the Son, yet learned he obedience; ſo every one that learnes obedience by afflictions, hath obtained a ſpeciall mercy from God: this is a ſpeciall mercy of God to prevent ſinne, to purge ſinne, and to cover ſinne; doth any man finde God mercifull in pardoning of ſinne, in covering ſin, and purging ſinne? he may by that be aſſured of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall mercy of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. The third uſe: is any man miſerable, are his miſeries great, are they ſpirituall, are they temporall? undoubtedly, if he be humbled in the ſence of them, and ſee himſelfe unworthy of any mercy, he may ſtill be aſſured of mercy; though there be ſpirituall evills, yet if a man ſee himſelfe wretched, and miſerable, the more heavie he findes his iniquity to be, the more hope of mercy there is for him: the Lords mercy is over all his works, therefore is he much more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſuch: If a man hath a feeling of his miſeries, and unworthineſſe, then he may uſe this argument for mercy; my miſeries are great; even as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>O Lord be mercifull to me! and pardon my iniquity, for it is great;</hi> and the more miſerable men are in their owne ſence, the fitter objects they are for God to ſhew mercy unto: Thus it was with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, and ſo with the Prodigall; therefore never
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102519:113"/>doubt though thy iniquities be never ſo great, there is a ſea of mercy in God. <hi>Bernard,</hi> well obſerves the difference, betwene Juſtice and mercy; Juſtice requires that there ſhould be deſart, but mercy looks upon them that are miſerable: and ſaith the father, true mercy doth affect miſery; mercy doth not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inquiſition, but it is glad to finde occaſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing it ſelfe: Thus every man in the middeſt of his miſery, knowes where to find mercy; he ſhall know he hath obtained mercy when God doth purge ſinne, &amp;c. then all his infirmities ſhall be paſſed over, God will never ſee them, and he ſhall have peace of conſcience in this life, and happineſſe hereafter.</p>

               <p>THE three laſt Attributes, we have ſpoken of, were love, grace, and mercy, which all proceeded from his goodneſſe; which have in the ſeverall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them, afforded great comfort, to wounded and diſtreſſed conſciences; and there be three more that follow, all proceeding from the ſame fountaine,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102519:114"/>that is from Gods goodneſſe; namely, juſtice, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and hatred; and theſe ſerve, for the awakning, and rowſing up of ſecure men out of their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: of theſe three, we may ſay as of the former, in ſubſtance they are but one; but yet being ſeverally handled, affoord very great variety of inſtruction, and other comforts; and the firſt of theſe, is the juſtice of God; and for the ground, we are to ſpeake of theſe two waies, that I have read; <hi>All his waies are juſt.</hi> To handle this as the former: firſt we will ſee what juſtice is, and ſo the firſt queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the juſtice of God, or of the divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is a communicable Attribute, whereby he executeth his law upon reaſonable creatures; rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the obedience of the godly; and puniſhing the diſobedience of the ungodly: This deſcription being laid down, we make it manifeſt after this manner; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or righteouſnes is Attributed to God, in ſeverall reſpects, it is Attributed to him: Firſt, as God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as he is a free Lord. Thirdly, as a father. Laſtly, as a Judge. For the three firſt, they all fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heads of other Attributes; therefore I paſſe them over, as not pertaining to this: but the juſtice of God as he is a Judge, as he is a juſt Judge; that is manifeſt by this text, <hi>All his waies are judgement, whatſoever he doth is juſt: Pſal.</hi> 119.117. <hi>Iuſt art thou Oh Lord! and juſt are thy judgements:</hi> therefore the Scriptures teacheth us, that he gives to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. and infinite the like; ſhewing, that this appertaines to him: Again,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102519:114"/>we ſay it is a communicable Attribute, becauſe there is the like to be found in man, though not ſo perfect as in God; yet there is a juſtice in man, and ſhould be in every man, to give to every man his own: The next thing we ſay, it is that, whereby he executes his laws; we call it the execution of the law, not the effecting the law in reaſonable creatures, reſpecting the preſcription; but the execution of the law upon reaſonable creatures, in reſpect of the cenſure: The former of theſe is the worke of grace, (as you have heard) a ſanctified obedience: The latter is the work of his juſtice; execution is the judgement of the law; and in this reſpect, the law is called judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. and in many other places, in reſpect of the cenſure, or penalty, that followes the breach of the law; beſides we ſay that all Gods works are in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as <hi>Salvian</hi> in another caſe ſpeakes, that it may be manifeſt that it was juſtice, and not power, that that did ſo; this is juſtice that doth it, and not power; we adde to this, the rewarding of the obedience of the godly, and puniſhing the diſobedience of the ungodly: ſo the Scripture is manifeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Thou wilt judge the people with equity Dan</hi> 4.34. <hi>Nebucadnezer</hi> ſaith, <hi>that all the waies of God are judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> this is that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>From henceforth is laid up for me a crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which God, the righteous judge ſhall give me: And God is faithfull and juſt, Heb.</hi> 6 12. <hi>that will not forget your workes, and labour of love, that you have ſhewed towards his ſaints:</hi> that is, will not forget to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102519:115"/>I come, and my reward is with me: And the Lord judgeth righteouſly without reſpect of perſon, Deu.</hi> 10.17. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>If you call him father that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons judgeth righteouſly, then paſſe the time of your dwelling here with fear:</hi> both are joined 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>It is a juſt thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you, and to give you reſt:</hi> Finally, <hi>David</hi> in 18. <hi>Pſal,</hi> 21. ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt dealt righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me,</hi> and 25. verſe, <hi>with every man.</hi> So that I have opened every part of this deſcription.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it thus Attributed to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is moſt willing to give every man his due; and whatſoever he doth, he cannot do unjuſtly: To examine, and explane this; I ſay, it is to give every man his due; the Lawyers define ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to be a conſtant, or perpetuall will, giving every man his due: if this be juſtice this may well be given to God; for who gives to every man his right, more then he, the Scriptures are apparent; for he gives to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man his owne, according to his workes, that he doth this, experience teacheth, and he doth it freely; he doth it not upon oath, he is not ſworne to it, he is a free Lord; and out of his love to juſtice he doth it: it is not with him as with others, that may doe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and have no love to it, therefore it is fitly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him: it is added further; whatſoever he doth, is juſt, he cannot do unjuſtly; becauſe the Lord is a free Lord; his will is the rule of juſtice: he is not a Lord ſworn to laws, as Princes comming to their kingdoms are ſworn, &amp;c. but a free Lord. God cannot go beyond law, his owne will is his law, and the rule of juſtice;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102519:115"/>whatſoever he wills, he wills it by his owne Eſſence; therefore whatſoever he wills is juſt &amp;c. Will he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the theefe upon the croſſe, and condemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? will he call <hi>Peter,</hi> and condemne <hi>Iudas?</hi> will he love <hi>Iacob</hi> and hate <hi>Eſau?</hi> he doth it juſtly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. (there is no rule for his will, but his will, which is the rule of juſtice:) howſoever man ſeeth no reaſon, that juſtice ſhould be juſt: <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaith, we cannot ſay that juſtice is unjuſt: Gods will is the rule of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and therefore it cannot be unjuſt; though man cannot be the reaſon of the juſtice.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you that he executes his law upon reaſonable creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe ſuch onely are capable of law; therefore the ſentence appertaines onely to them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of reward, or puniſhment: we manifeſt this, they only are ſubject to the law, becauſe the law was given to reaſonable creatures, and none elſe: In the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it was written in their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was written in tables of ſtone, it was written in their hearts; in whoſe? in the hearts of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. After, when it was written in tables of ſtone, to whom was it given? to reaſonable creatures; and therefore they are bound to the obedience of it: ſo that the execution of the law, belongs to them; as the Apoſtle ſaith, whatſoever the Lord ſpake, he ſpake it to thoſe that were under the law; unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures naturally have no judgement, therefore they are not ſubject to the law: Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, true it is, that Gods juſtice ſometimes takes hold of the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, but it is not for themſelves, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102519:116"/>ſinne they have committed; but for their ſinnes to whom they belong, and for whom they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that have the uſe of them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. that judgement, curſed ſhall be the earth; but for what? for its owne ſake? no, but for mans; as when God bleſſed the creatures, he bleſſed them for mans ſake; ſo when he curſes them, he curſes them for mans ſake; therefore we ſay, it is executed upon reaſonable creatures.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you, that by Iuſtice he rewards the obedience of the godly, and puniſhes the diſobedience of the wicked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is bound, to the one by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to the other by due deſert: we will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen this; I ſay, he is bound to the one by promiſe; for the righteouſneſſe, and converſation of any man whatſoever, never deſerved any thing at the hand of God; becauſe that good which they doe, is none of their owne: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to thinke a good thought.</hi> Is there then a good will? no the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God works in us the will and the deed, Philip.</hi> 2.13 as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks: my God whatſoever I have is thy donation, thou giveſt all: and in many other places; whatſoever he be, that numbers his merits, he hath nothing; if he have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what then can helpe him? Againe, whatſoever he hath is ſtained: how then ſhall that which is ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, tainted, and defiled like a menſtruous cloath, merit any thing at the hands of God? therefore if God reward any mans righteouſneſſe, he doth it not out of merit, yet out of juſtice: becauſe he is bound
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102519:116"/>to them by promiſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.41, 42. <hi>He that receives a diſciple, in the name of a diſciple, ſhall have a diſciples reward:</hi> he that gives him a cup of cold water, ſhall not loſe his reward: whilſt God promiſes ſo great a reward to ſo little a worke, it ſhewes it is of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and not of merit: and hence it is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> appeales to juſtice, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>I have fought the good fight, &amp;c. from hence is laid up for me a crowne of righteouſneſſe, which God the righteous judge ſhall give me.</hi> It is a crowne given, not merited; yet an act of righteouſneſſe to give it, becauſe promiſed. God hath made himſelfe a debtor, (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>) not by receiving any thing from man, but by making promiſes to man; and promiſe, we know, is due debt; therefore we ſay that he is bound to the one by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to the other he ſtands bound by due deſert. But it may be objected, Why ſhould the ſinnes of men deſerve, and not their good workes? Becauſe that which is good, is neither their owne, nor perfect, and is therefore recompenſed in much mercy, according to promiſe. That which is evill, is their owne, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their owne corruption, and abſolutely evill, and therefore puniſhed according to deſert in juſtice. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, our good things are not purely good, but our evill things are purely evill; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God when he comes to judge, he judges one by mercy, reſpecting his promiſe; and the other by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, duely rewarding them. And thus we have ſeene this deſcription opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe teacheth us, that though the workes of God ſeeme to us, at any time unjuſt, yet
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102519:117"/>we muſt acknowledge them juſt. Though fleſh and blood cannot ſee the reaſon of them, fleſh and blood muſt be ſilent, and ſay, it is juſtice that hath done it. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, the reaſon of man is after one way, and the juſtice of God after another. All the works of God paſt, preſent, and to come, are done in juſtice; all his wayes are judgement: therefore though we can ſee no cauſe why he ſhould do them, we muſt lay our hands upon our mouthes: For inſtance; did God caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe for eating fruit? and did he bring a curſe upon all his poſterity? though we can give a reaſon, or though we could not give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, yet it is juſt, for God hath done it. You will ſay, What? for ſo ſmall a thing, to bring a curſe upon him, and all his poſterity? though humane ſence can ſee no reaſon, yet it is juſt; ſo, that that God did, in deſtroying <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> and all their families, wives and children, if we could ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, yet it were juſt. Againe, did the Lord elect ſome to ſalvation? and doth he reprobate others? can we give no reaſon for it? juſtice hath done it: doth he harden ſome, and ſhew mercy to others? all is juſtly done. In all theſe, though the reaſon be hid from us, yet we may not deny that which is apparant: though we cannot ſee why it ſhould be done, yet God hath done it, and we muſt reſt ſatisfied, that it is juſt: hath God made veſſels of honour, and diſhonour? the Apoſtle teacheth us, in theſe caſes to anſwer objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Oh the greatneſſe, and riches of the wiſedome and knowledge of God, &amp;c.</hi> how ſecret are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102519:117"/>it is enough for us to ſtand amazed at them, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into them. Secondly, if any aske further, Why did he ſo? the anſwer is, <hi>Rom</hi> 9.14. that there is no unrighteouſneſſe with God. Theſe two things Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſed to anſwer to the Pelagians: I have this anſwer (ſaith the Father,) Oh the deepeneſſe both of the wiſdome and mercy of God, &amp;c! and if you will be wrangling yet; I anſwer further, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.14. <hi>There is no unrighteouſneſſe with God:</hi> and if you will know any more, ſeeke you other teachers; but beware you doe not finde preſumptuous men, that will take upon them to ſearch Gods counſell: happily, here may be other Objections, as this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it juſt (ſeeing all men are concluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinne) that God ſhould free ſome men from ſinne, and leave other men in ſinne: how ſhould this ſtand with Gods juſtice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer: If God did free ſome men from puniſhment, without ſatisfaction; then he could not be juſt, but when he frees none, but thoſe for whom he is fully ſatisfied, his juſtice is not impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is true indeede, that no man ſatisfies for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor could finde out a means of ſatisfaction, but it was Grace, not injuſtice, for God, out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his mercy and wiſdome, to finde out a meanes to ſatisfie his juſtice, which they that had ſinned could never have thought of: It was free for him to ſend his Sonne to redeeme ſome; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that our forgiveneſſe, is of mercy; but <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of juſtice, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.9. <hi>God is faithfull and juſt, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſinnes:</hi> the reaſon is from the 7. verſe, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102519:118"/>the blood of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, hath cleanſed us from all ſinne:</hi> and ſo he doth it for juſtice, and not without mercy. It is true, his election was free in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of man: Juſtification was free in reſpect of man, but it was grace that found out a meanes to ſave ſome; and yet, becauſe he would have his juſtice ſatisfied, he ſent his Son, that he might dye for them he would ſave.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Happily ſome will ſay, this ſeemes to he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, that God ſhould puniſh his wicked ſervants, and alſo puniſh them upon the back of his dutifull Son?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, with Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> true it is, that to the righteouſneſſe of mans juſtice it ſeemes he doth injuſtice, that for wicked ſervants doth give to death a good Sonne; but ſaith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is the admirable pietie, that the greatneſſe of his juſtice exceeded mans reaſon; though this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice hath a ſhew of injuſtice to man: that God ſhould lay the ſinnes of others upon him; yet was it juſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſinnes were accounted his; he was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, the head and husband of his Church; and therefore for God to require their ſinnes of him, was no injuſtice. Their ſinnes were made his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He that knew no ſinne was made ſinne for us:</hi> a ſacrifice for ſinne. Not to ſtand upon this, our ſinnes are all laid upon his ſcore: here mercy and juſtice kiſſe each other; mercy in this, that he found out a meanes to ſatisfie juſtice in this, that he would have ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this he laid upon Chriſt, becauſe he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and freely tooke our ſinnes upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This doth manifeſt, that there is a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102519:118"/>of the laſt day, wherein God will judge the world; and ſo anſwers that objection againſt the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, which ſometimes ſtumbled <hi>David, Pſa.</hi> 73. <hi>Ierem</hi> 12.2, 3. that the godly have their wayes hedged with thornes, and are in much affliction; but what is the eſtate of the wicked? Now they have the Pipe, and the Harpe, and are in a proſperous and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtate, &amp;c. Well, amongſt many other things that may be anſwered, there is a day wherein he will judge them, though now ſometimes the Lord defers their puniſhment, yet he is not unjuſt, as one ſaith well; that that is deferred, is not taken away, forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is no quittance; God will juſtly reward both the good and wicked, in a fit opportunity.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doth he deferre the puniſhment of the wicked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe by this meanes he would draw them to goodneſſe, or make his forbearance a greater meanes of their condemnation. And ſo he deferres to recompence his owne, becauſe he would try their faith, and conſtancy, and goodneſſe; ſo that by this meanes they are more eſtabliſhed in goodneſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other men periſh; <hi>eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh:</hi> there are many ſecret ſinnes, that lye in good men, that God oftentimes by theſe meanes makes them to finde out. Of the wicked, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſome are puniſhed in this life, and that but a few, becauſe he reſerves them for an eternall puniſhment. So then it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, there muſt be a day wherein God will judge the world; and though the Lord ſpares the wicked, it is no good to them, nor mercy; and it is not againſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102519:119"/>to ſpare them, that he might, when he comes, makes his juſtice more apparant afterwards: ſo that there muſt needes be a judgement to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Is God juſt? this is to awaken the ſecure and drowſie profeſſor, and alſo the carefull Chriſtian; though he muſt go through evill reproofes and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet God is juſt: howſoever he can call for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at his juſtice, by merit &amp; deſert, yet by promiſe he may: let him lay hold upon the promiſes, and they ſhould ſtay and ſtrengthen his heart. On the other ſide, juſtice ſhould make all carnall men to remember that they muſt come to give an account. God ſhould be unjuſt, if he ſhould not recompence the wayes and workes of every man: therefore theſe men ſhould be awakened out of that ſecurity wherein they are: doe not thou thinke that thou haſt loſt thy good workes, and thy practice of godlineſſe ſhall goe unrewarded; God is juſt in his promiſe: on the other ſide, if thou haſt done wicked workes (though God doth not come preſently to puniſh them) preſume not of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity; if God be God, certainly thoſe ſinnes which thou haſt committed when thou waſt a youth, when thou waſt a ſervant, when thou waſt a maſter, ſhall not goe unpuniſhed; for God is juſt. When the act is ceaſed and gone, it may be thou thinkeſt thy ſinne is gone; it is not ſo, the act is ceaſed, the guilt remains ſtill, and God will call every worke to judgement; every worke, good and bad: therefore labour that thou never forget it, unleſſe thou doe undoe it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: this ſhould make every man carefull and watchfull over his wayes, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith; God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102519:119"/>hath two feet, Mercy and Juſtice; there be two ſignes of theſe feet in the heart of man, feare and hope; feare, becauſe God is juſt; hope, becauſe God is mercifull: ſometimes the heart is fearfull, then there is the image of his juſtice; and ſometimes there is hope, and then there is the image of his mercy: kiſſe not one alone, and imbrace not one alone; imbrace not mercy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſtice, leſt thou grow ſecure; nor juſtice without mercy, leſt thou deſpaire: keepe both theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they ſhall keepe thee in the feare and love of God. We conclude then, that this is an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the godly, and a diſcouragement to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. <hi>We muſt all appeare before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt: we therefore,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>knowing the terrors of the Lord, perſwade men:</hi> that is, ſeeing God is juſt, we labour to awaken men, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat men, we encourage men in good, we diſſwade men from ſinne, &amp;c. therefore brethren, knowing that God will bring every thing to judgement, let us breake off our ſinnes: ſeeing he hath appointed a time, wherein he will judge the world; he commands every man every where to repent, that they may take away the matter of his juſtice. Againe, what manner of men ought we to be, in all holy and godly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; in as much as we know, that our labour is not in vaine in the Lord: let us not be weary in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In one word, let us not goe on in ſinne, for though we get the pleaſure of it, yet remember what followes after, God is juſt, and the wages of ſinne is death: it will be bitterneſſe in the end. Let us not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from the wayes of God, from proceeding on
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102519:120"/>in goodneſſe: let us withſtand the provocations of ſinne, then ſhall we have peace here, and hereafter the benefit of the juſtice of God, according to his mercifull promiſe, to reward our well-doing in the life to come for ever.</p>

               <p>IN the former words, as you have heard, we have ſpoken of the Juſtice of God; the next Attribute is the Anger of God: for the ground of which, we have made choyce of theſe words; <hi>Behold, thou art wrath, for we have ſinned:</hi> and of this in the ſame order as before: and ſo the firſt Queſtion to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the anger of God, or of the Divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a communicable Attribute, whereby he being angry with his creatures (ſinning) juſtly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, threatneth, and executeth puniſhment upon them; this is the deſcription of Gods anger, and the opening of it is after this manner. Firſt, anger, as it is in man, a paſſion, is not, nor may be attributed to God; for we
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102519:120"/>ſay it doth not become a wiſe man to be angry, much leſſe the wiſe God, but is attributed to God as the former: that is, as anger is mixed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may not be attributed to God, yet generally taken, it may.</p>
               <p>There be two things to be conſidered in anger, as it is in man; Firſt, called the matter. Secondly, the forme: for the matter of anger, I ſay, it is a paſſion naturally inflaming the bloud with deſire of revenge; and cauſes a man to goe out of himſelfe: in which reſpect, it can be no way given to God, becauſe he is ſo ſimple pure, that no impurity can be given to him; now this proceeds from the ſenſuall part, and ſo it is both in man, and beaſt, and cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God. Secondly, as it proceedes from mans will, joined with deteſtation of evill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to puniſh evill; ſo it may be attributed to God: and of this the Prophet ſpeakes, in this place: behold thou art angry, for we have ſinned. I ſay, that God is angry with ſinne; it is in this place manifeſt, that all Gods anger, is againſt ſinne: ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe &amp;c.</hi> where we ſee, that God is angry with ſinne: and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 3.5. recounts up ſeverall ſinnes, as fornication, wantonneſſe, covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. and for ſuch ſinnes, the wrath of God comes upon the children of diſobedience; and in the 5. <hi>Ephe.</hi> when he had reckoned up divers ſins, in the 6. verſe he comes and ſaies, <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words; for theſe things the wrath of God comes upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience.</hi> The next thing is this, whereby
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102519:121"/>he is angry with his creatures, juſtly willing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing puniſhment; it is juſt if he will it, becauſe his will is the rule of juſtice, and he wills not puniſhment out of paſſion, as a man doth; it comes not from the ſenſuall appetite, as it doth from man, but it proceeds from Gods will averſe from the creature, ſinning: and this willing, or decreeing puniſhment, is called the anger of God: and ſo anger is put for the decree of anger: ſo it is taken, he is a God of anger, keeping wrath for his adverſaries.</p>
               <p>The next we ſay, he doth not onely decree, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce judgement, &amp; ſo anger in the Scriptures, is put for threatning of anger: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chaſten me, &amp;c.</hi> that is, doe not lay upon me, that thou haſt threatned in thy law; where anger is not put for the decree, nor the execution, but for the denouncing: ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. and ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.9. I will not execute my fierce wrath; that is, I will not execute my wrath, as I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it: Again, it is ſaid, he executes puniſhment on the wicked; he declares it not onely, but executeth it: ſo anger is put for the execution of anger; <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Who hath forwarned you to fly from the wrath to come:</hi> that is, from the puniſhment, that the anger of God hath decreed: ſo likewiſe in other places, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. laſt verſe, <hi>He hath delivered us from wrath to come. Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>We are ſaved from wrath:</hi> So that this ſheweth, that anger, is put for the execution of anger. Next we ſay, that he doth declare, and execute puniſhment; puniſhment is two fold; it is temporall, and it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: The puniſhments in this life, are upon mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102519:121"/>eſtates, goods, &amp;c. as is threatned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. eternall puniſhments, are they which are prepared for the devill and his Angels, and thoſe that are ſeduced by him. The next thing is ſaid, he executes his law upon all offenders: offenders, are of two ſorts; Elect, and Reprobate; ſome children, others ſervants; and of theſe, to the one, he hath decreed temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment onely: and to the other, he decrees, declares, pronounces, executes, both temporall, and eternall puniſhments: his owne, are free from the eternall, but the other are not free from temporall: but he laies upon the wicked, ſome temporall puniſhments, as a revenge againſt impenitency; yet theſe ſatisfie not his juſtice, and therefore are followed with everlaſting torments, in hell fire, when God takes of wicked men, and Angels, a full and juſt revenge, becauſe they have not ſatisfied his juſtice: chaſtiſements, God laies upon his owne, but not everlaſting torments: becauſe his juſtice is ſatisfied for them, by his ſonne; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. that he is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry for ever, neither deales he with us according to our ſinnes. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.8. He deales with them in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in the branches, but with the wicked in the root; he deales with his owne, as the Husbandman deals with his frute trees, which he doth prune, and cut off the unprofitable branches, &amp;c. On the other ſide, when he deales with the wicked, he deales with them in the root, ſtocking them up; but not to ſtand long; God ſometimes inflicts puniſhments upon his owne children, and they may be bitter, and ſharp, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. No afflictions for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102519:122"/>are pleaſant: but this he doth, that they may not be condemned with the world: and he deales pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with the wicked; and this he doth, becauſe they are veſſels of wrath prepared for deſtruction: and thus I have opened this deſcription.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is anger Attributed to God, or to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe that God is good and gracious. We will explane this, after this manner: that which is good, muſt be angry becauſe it is good: it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to goodneſſe, to be oppoſite to evill; as it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to evill, to be oppoſite to good: experience teacheth us, that the worſer any man is, the more he is offended, with that which is good; and no man can be good, unleſſe he be offended with evill; and the more good a man is, the more he is offended with ſin; therefore God being goodneſſe it ſelf, muſt needs have anger againſt ſinne. Secondly, God is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: now theſe two, anger, and graciouſneſſe in God are oppoſite one to another; the grace of God is only to ſome, not to all; his anger is to others: all are not under favour, therefore there muſt needs be anger in God; all by nature corrupted are under anger: ſo it is, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.3. So we are by nature the children of wrath. They who are reconciled, are the children of mercy: they that are not reconciled, are children of anger: therefore God being good and gracious, anger is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you, by this anger, he wills, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, threatens, and executes puniſhments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe he is moſt wiſe, moſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102519:122"/>mereifull, ſlow to anger, moſt juſt, not making the wicked innocent; to explane theſe: Firſt, he decrees, and therefore moſt wiſe, this comes from the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; that he doth, he doth it not upon paſſion, but upon deliberation; eſpecially when he comes to matter of anger: this appeares, for God ſpeakes of himſelfe to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.21. <hi>I am come downe to ſee whether Sodome be ſo wicked &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doe execute, I will ſee; not that God knew it not, but to ſhew how ſlow he is to anger: in like caſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.21. <hi>Doth not the Lord remember and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, before he comes to execute his anger:</hi> when he hath decreed it, he doth not preſently execute it, but he doth denounce it: why? becauſe he is moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, ſlow to wrath, and therefore he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 34.7. He is a God that will not puniſh, but upon neceſſity; he would willingly be alwaies ſhewing good, and when he is angry, he is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and provoked to it; and becauſe he would not willingly puniſh, therefore he denounces puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he ſpeakes often, before he will doe it once, that if it might be, he might be prevenred by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Laſtly, after threatning, he proceeds to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, not with delight; (God delights not in the death of a ſinner, he afflicts not willingly) but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. As <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour, before he ſacked the City of Jeruſalem, wept over it, pittying them he ſhould deſtroy it; ſo doth God, when threatnings prevaile not, and by them, men are not reclaimed, then he comes to execution; becauſe he is juſt; that he may not make the wicked innocent: how is that? by ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102519:123"/>to execute his juſtice on them: for ſo I remember <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he ſhould not make the wicked innocent: how is that? thou ſhalt not, ſaith he, let them goe with peace to the grave: though I did not execute judgement upon them, yet thou ſhalt do it: as <hi>Savian</hi> ſaith of Sodom, that God ſhewed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in that he was long before he did execute; and juſtice, and wrath, in that he did execute at laſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is this wrath Attributed, to execute puniſhment upon offenders?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he puniſhes impartially, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects no perſon; we will explane this: it is true, it is the perſon he puniſhes, but he puniſhes him for ſinne; who ever ſinnes, him he puniſhes: he ſpares not his owne, but puniſhes them, ſometimes more ſharply then others; this ſhewes that he is impartiall, in that he puniſheth them, not onely when they be unrepentants, but when they be repentants, though not in themſelves, yet in their ſurety; that is Chriſt: ſo that he accepts no mans perſon: repentance takes not away puniſhment, but doth ſo much prevaile with God, that he laies it upon Chriſt; he was beaten for our tranſgreſſions: and though ſometimes he puniſhes one, and the ſame ſinne differently, more in one then in another, it is not for the perſon, but to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe impartiall; namely when circumſtances make the ſin greater; then he laies the puniſhment greater, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.9. If the Prieſts daughter committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, ſhe ſhould be burnt, in as much as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances made her ſin the greater; and thus, you ſee the ground of this.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:102519:123"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt uſe is: This teaches us, that anger it not ſimply evill, when the Scripture forbids it; it doth not ſimply forbid it: why? becauſe it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, and nothing that is ſimply evill can be attributed to God; Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, ſimple affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in us by nature; being corrupted by our fall they are become ſinfull, whereas by creation, they are naturally good; but they are morally good in God, ſo anger applied to God, is morally good: Anger is ſo farre from being ill, that a man cannot without it avoyd evill, nor walke in the practice of godlineſſe as he ought. Anger preſerves the works of vertue: A man of anger is like to a Souldier that hath put on his armor ready at the command of the Captaine; Anger is the hand of reaſon, the Souldier of reaſon, to fight for God againſt ſinne; anger is the ſinewes of the ſoule; it makes a man zelous againſt ſinne, and he that hath not this is in ſmall meaſure godly, he is no way profitable, for anger helpes a man againſt every ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; hereupon the father uſes a ſimilitude: anger is like to the Shepheards dogge: how is that? thus, he barks at every ſtranger, but is quiet with his maſters friends, and faunes upon them: ſo is anger in the heart of man, let ſinne come, anger ſets upon it, &amp;c. Anger truely ſanctified is that which will oppoſe any corruption that ſhall be offered: In theſe reſpects and many ſuch, anger is very profitable: Anger ſaith one, is like the edge of a knife, and God hath put it into the hand of man; what uſe is there of a knife? to cut off all unprofitable branches; ſo of anger, &amp;c. thus much of this uſe.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:102519:124"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The next uſe is this, it ſhould teach men to feare the wrath of God; men ought to feare ſinne, becauſe they ought to feare the anger of God: If men ſinne, certainely God will be angry; looke what ſinne God hath revealed his wrath from heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, that ſinne feare; for inſtance, God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his wrath from heaven againſt ſuch as contemne the word, and ſacraments: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.36. <hi>They mocked his meſſengers, and deſpiſed his Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> then his wrath came, and there was no remedy: So <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.22.24. <hi>Woe unto Capernaum, it ſhall be eaſier for Sodom, and Gomorrah then for thee:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. for this cauſe many are ſick, &amp;c. God hath revealed his wrath againſt the injurers, againſt Sodom, &amp;c. but eſpecially againſt impenitency; that is, when men notwithſtanding they heare the word of God denounced againſt ſinne, yet they bleſſe themſelves: <hi>Deutr.</hi> 29.29. he ſaith my wrath and Jealouſie ſhall burne againſt that man. Reade the Scriptures, and every where you ſhall finde ſome monuments of the wrath of God; conſider, and when you are tempted to ſinne, lay the wrath of God againſt that ſinne. Art thou a deſpiſer of Gods word, art thou an abuſer of his ſervants, or a prophaner of his ſabbaths, and feareſt not thou the wrath of God, that he ſhould breake out againſt theſe ſinnes? this ſhewes that thou art ſhut up in impenitency; therefore the wrath of God and his Jealouſie ſhall burne againſt thee.</p>
               <p>For the concluſion, know, that he is the ſame God that he was; there is the ſame juſtice, the ſame wrath,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102519:124"/>and he will certainly puniſh the ſame ſinnes, out of the ſame juſtice; art thou a deſperate man? this ſhould make thee feare; God muſt ſmite thee, elſe he were unjuſt. If any man deſire to get the feare of God, what an excellent helpe hath he from hence? let him conſider God is the Lord of fury: This one truth rivetted upon the heart of man, will purge out all uncleanenes, and wicked works, that he ſhall not dare to move a member to ſinne, nor give appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the leaſt motions of iniquity injected to his heart, though he cannot prevent the ariſing of them: for the expectation of the puniſhment will keepe him off, &amp;c. as for inſtance, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſtretched forth his hand againſt the meſſenger of God, but being ſmitten he ſpareth him: ſo many ſtretch their tongues, and ſpeake againſt the miniſters; if this conſideration were in their hearts it would keepe them from this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and they ſhould eſcape the wrath to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Is God a God of anger againſt men for ſinne? doth any man lie under this anger, and deſires to be freed from it? let him labour to pacify this anger of God; then you will aske me, but how is this anger pacified? I anſwer, by taking away that with which he is provoked: Take away fuell from the fire, and it will be ſoone extinguiſhed; take away that which provokes God, which is ſinne, and anger will quickly ceaſe: <hi>Iere.</hi> 18.7.8. The Lord ſaith, If I threaten evill againſt a nation, and that nation repent, I will alſo repent: Take away the matter, and Gods anger will be taken away; If <hi>Acham</hi> and his excommunicate thing be ſtoned, and burnt, the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102519:125"/>anger of the Lord ceaſes againſt Iſraell; If <hi>Ionah</hi> be caſt into the Sea, the ſtorme ceaſes; If the Ninivites turne from their ſinne, the Lord will turne from their puniſhment; therefore if any man would be freed from the anger of God, then he muſt take away ſinne; The anger of God is like the Parents anger; Parents take delight in doeing good and are never angry, but when they are provoked: ſo it is with God, it is his nature to delight in doeing good, he is not angry but when he is provoked unto it: This is that the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27. Anger is not in me; but how ſhall this agree with that place before ſpoken of? God is the God of anger: <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.2. I anſwer, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. The Lord afflicts no man willingly: mercy is naturall to God, but to be angry, and wrath, is a forced motion: ſo that if we ceaſe that which provokes, he will ſtay his anger: they take a wrong courſe that think of any thing to appeaſe God, but the removing of ſinne: the holy Ghoſt complaines, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.8. That when he threatned judgement to come upon them, they began to thinke of their Armor, and their Fortreſſes, and their ſtrong Walls, but never thought of the matter that provoked the Lord: and whereas they ſhould have betaken themſelves to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. they betake themſelves to feaſting; this iniquity (ſaith he) ſhall not be taken away from them untill they die: when <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> was ſick, he never ſought to the Lord, that was not the way he took for his recovery, but to the Phyſitian; and <hi>Iſrael</hi> to King <hi>Iareb, Hoſ.</hi> 5. but he could not heale him. There are ſome that ſeeke to God, yet they nevertake
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102519:125"/>away ſinne, therefore they cannot have Gods anger taken away; or if God doe take away his anger from them, it is in greater anger: many men bleſſe God that he hath eaſed them of a plague, when yet they have not left their ſinne; I ſay to ſuch, it is a greater judgement for thee to have the plague removed: theſe men that when they are under a judgement, cry for eaſe, but remove not the cauſe of their paine, which is ſinne; are like to the patient, that goes to the Chyrurgian for eaſe, and there is yet in the wound, a little bone, or ſplinter which he will not let the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgian take out, without the taking out of which there can be no eaſe.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is this; would any man have the anger of God taken away from him? he muſt ſearch to finde the cauſe of this anger, he muſt ſearch to find the plague in his owne heart, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. thus ſaith <hi>Ieremiah, Lamen.</hi> 3. why is living man ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull? man ſuffereth for his ſinne; let us ſearch and try our waies and turne unto the Lord: take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which provokes the Lord, and labour to be angry with thy ſinne, and God will ceaſe to be angry with thee.</p>

               <p>THE next thing is, the Hatred of God: and to hold the ſame courſe we have held before: our firſt Queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the hatred of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is thus much; the hatred of God is a communicable Attribute, whereby he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decrees not to ſhew mercy, but to deny to moſt the grace of election, deſtinating them to deſtruction, exactly puniſhing them when they are wicked, and ſo hating all iniquity.</p>
               <p>This deſcription hath a great deale of matter in it, therefore we will explane it. Hatred, ſay ſome, is not to be attributed to God; we doe not contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, if they underſtand hatred to be a paſſion of the minde, which is ſeldome without corruption; but when they take hatred, as the Scriptures ſpeake of it; then, as God loves that which is good, ſo he hates that which is nought and evill: for as God is ſaid to love, ſo he is ſaid to hate. Againe, I ſay it is a communicable attribute, becauſe that there is the like in man: next, it is that by which he freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102519:126"/>not to ſhew mercy to the wicked, to deny to them the grace of election. To open this: hatred, in the Scriptures doth many times ſignifie to refuſe, to give and to deny favours; to put behinde, and make leſſe account of one then another, as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 14 26. <hi>He that hateth not his father and his mother, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he that doth not deny his father, by putting him behinde him, and neglecting him, when he commands any thing, and God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: God ſaw that <hi>Leah</hi> was hated, that is, was not ſo dearely loved as <hi>Rahel:</hi> ſo this hatred of God is to neglect to ſhew favour, and to deny the grace of election to the wicked: this is apparant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I have hated Eſan, and loved Iacob:</hi> this is not put down but with oppoſition: <hi>I have loved Iacob, and hated E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau:</hi> that is to ſay, I have not decreed nor offered this grace and favour of election to <hi>Eſau,</hi> which I have allowed to <hi>Iacob:</hi> it is that which is further manifeſt in the 18. verſe of the ſame chapter, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will, and whom I will I harden, &amp;c.</hi> This God doth freely from his owne will; his will is the ſolitary cauſe of denying the grace of election: the cauſe why he choſe <hi>Iacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> was nothing but his will: it is manifeſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.12. before they had done good or evil, God ſaid, that the elder ſhould ſerve the yonger, that it might be of grace: if you aske the Apoſtle a proofe of this, he alledges a place out of <hi>Exodus:</hi> if any man ſhould wrangle with God, and ſay, God is unjuſt, that he ſhould love one, and hate another; the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>There is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe with God, ver.</hi> 14. and for this he gives
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102519:127"/>a proofe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.19. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and whom I will, &amp;c.</hi> As God doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely love whom he will, ſo he doth abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate whom he will; he denies the grace of election to the moſt: there are but a few that have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Many are called.</hi> The next thing is, that he deſtinates them to deſtruction, as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne. <hi>Iude</hi> 4. men were before of old ordained to this condemnation: <hi>He hath prepared To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of old, Eſa.</hi> 30. <hi>ult.</hi> not that God doth delight in the torment of the creature, or created any thing that he might deſtroy it; but out of his hatred to ſinne, and love of juſtice, did decree, and prepare to puniſh all, and onely ſuch as ſhould live and dye in ſinne, without repentance. That negative act of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or preterition findes all men alike, in the ſame condition; this poſitive act of predamnation, reſpects men as ſinners, without repentance. That firſt act is grounded onely on the abſolute will of God, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will, &amp;c. and whom I will I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> but this latter act is an act not ſo much of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as of juſtice, and alwayes hath reſpect to ſinne. The third thing, That he actually puniſhes them when they are wicked: It is manifeſt, that they that be born in ſinne, and live in ſinne, knowing it to be ſinne, be enemies to God, and to the grace of God; and them he actually hates when they are wicked. This is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant; <hi>Thou hateſt all thoſe that worke wickedneſſe;</hi> and that hatred carries the puniſhment, as appeares by the next words of my Text; <hi>and thou deſtroyeſt all thoſe that tell lyes:</hi> and therefore he doth not hate
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102519:127"/>them, as they are men, and his creatures, but as they are wicked. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, man could not endure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods making, but he would be better; therefore he was caſt out of Paradiſe, Godhating all iniquity in whomſoever it was, elect or reprobate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Thou loveſt righteouſneſſe, and hateſt iniquity:</hi> and this I might ſhew unto you, that there is no ſinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, but I can bring you a plaine text of Gods hatred of it; ſometimes hating idolatry, ſometimes hating blood, ſometimes falſe weights, ſometimes contempt of his Word, ſometimes wicked thoughts; all which ſhew, that he hates iniquity: two wayes he manifeſts he hates it; in ſome, becauſe he deſtroyes them for it: in others, becauſe he tooke it away by juſtice, in his owne Sonne. And thus much for this deſcription.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How juſtly can God decree and deſtinate men to hatred and deſtruction abſolutely?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is thus: Becauſe he is the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of all, the Lord over all; by either of which, he may decree what he pleaſe concerning his creatures. We manifeſt this: firſt, that he is the creator of all, no man makes queſtion; then if he made all as he would, and to what end he would, (deformed in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or deſtitute of good, <hi>Eſai</hi> 64.8. <hi>We are the clay, and thou art the potter, we are all the workes of thy hands,</hi>) may not he the Potter, of one and the ſame lumpe, make one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonor. If he may make a veſſell as he will, then he may doe with it what he will, <hi>Rom</hi> 9.20, 21. when he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of mans reprobation, there may be ſome that would queſtion with him, and ſay; How is this juſt?
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102519:128"/>he anſwers, <hi>What are thou oh man! that diſputeſt with God? ſhall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, Why madeſt thou me ſo?</hi> So <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>The potter hath power over the clay, and hath not the Lord much more power over us?</hi> Secondly, He is an abſolute Lord over us, What followes then? he may therefore for the manifeſtation of the greatneſſe of his mercy, appoint ſome to glory, and ſome to deſtruction. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is abſolute Lord: marke the place in which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Potter, What if God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew his wrath, to make his power knowne, endure with much patience, the veſſels of wrath, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to deſtruction; that he may magnifie his wrath upon the one, and his grace upon the other? So alſo in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. in a great mans houſe there are veſſels to diſhonour, and ſome to honour; the abſolute Lord may appoint what he will: the Lord is abſolute Lord of his houſe, he may appoint ſome to honour, and others to diſhonour. To conclude this with a ſpeech of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> againſt our univerſaliſts; they plead that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is all for them, he uſes a pretty ſpeech; the firſt man came into the world without originall ſinne, and was made of a pure maſſe; God might then appoint ſome to deſtruction, and who dares come to God, and ſay, Why haſt thou done ſo? ſhall they of like condition come and reaſon with God, Why diddeſt thou chooſe him, and refuſe me? there is the like in him as there is in me, Why haſt thou done ſo? the anſwer ſhall be this; Hath not the Potter power over the clay, to chooſe one veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to honour, and another to diſhonour. So that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102519:128"/>we ſee that God may juſtly deny the grace of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid, that God actually hates and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes men, when they are wicked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is juſt, he may actually hate them when they are wicked: he decrees it before, but then he actually hates them: we manifeſt it after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Whatſoever he decrees, he executes not till he have cauſe, becauſe he is juſt. Of the former, namely that God ſhould decree, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, there are cauſes ſecret to man, but there is no unjuſt cauſe. Of the latter, that he actually hates them, the cauſe is manifeſt, they are actually wicked.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>The laſt thing: Why ſay you, that he hates all iniquity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is good and righteous, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; therefore he cannot chooſe but hate ſinne: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more proper to love, then to hate that which is an enemy to that which is beloved: nothing more proper to God, then to hate ſinne, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is apparant thou loveſt righteouſneſſe, and hateſt iniquity. So that you ſee, I have opened this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: out of which there may be made many Uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This teacheth us, firſt, what to beleeve and profeſſe in thoſe great and controverted points, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning univerſall grace, election, reprobation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, &amp;c. in which we muſt be wiſe to ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we daſh not into errors: God (as hath bin ſaid) did love ſome above others, with a ſpeciall love, for whom he hath prepared grace and glory:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102519:129"/>thoſe whom he did not love with this ſpeciall love, he paſſed over, and for them he prepared neither grace nor glory: and thus farre we goe without ſtraights; for it is granted by all, that God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that grace and glory, which he gives to others, and paſſe them over; becauſe to ſome grace and glory are his owne free gift, and he may doe what he will with his owne. But ſay ſome, God cannot juſtly deſtinate men to deſtruction, before they are wicked; to doe ſo, would be tyranny, &amp;c. To this we anſwer; it is high preſumption, for duſt and aſhes to limit the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and abſolute dominion of the almighty, yea ſo much as to queſtion, what God may doe; woe unto him that ſtrives with his maker, ſaith the Lord by <hi>Iſaiah: Who hath injoyned him his way,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu?</hi> if, as the Potter out of the ſame lumpe, makes one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonour, who ſhall charge him with injuſtice? Is God tyed to any? who hath given to the Lord, to make him a debtor? Injuſtice is the violation of a right; there is no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, where there is nothing due: indeede if God had deſtinated a creature to torment, being innocent; this had not bin an act of juſtice, but of ſoveraignty; yet was it not an act of injuſtice, becauſe of ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But this problematicall queſtion is to us need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; there is no cauſe of flying to the abſolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and royall power of God, to anſwer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. To the Law and to the Teſtimony, God hath ſufficiently declared and juſtified the equality of his own wayes; let us with meekneſſe and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpirit, ſeeke and ſubmit to the revealed trueth:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102519:129"/>God hath prepared grace, and glory, for ſome that were not worthy of it: admire the richneſſe, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his grace, and goodneſſe, he hath not done the like for all; ſit downe in ſilence, he hath done thee no wrong: but he hath prepared ſome for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; no, man prepares himſelfe for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his ſin: <hi>Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe, oh Iſrael!</hi> God onely prepares deſtruction for the ſinner, he hath prepared Tophet of old; and what injuſtice is there in this? God made his creature holy, and able to ſtand; his creature left to himſelfe, forſakes his holineſſe, and ſins: God decrees to puniſh him for this ſinne, and doth puniſh him; <hi>Are not the waies of God equall?</hi> thus God cannot juſtly be charged with mans perdition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But he is the cauſe of all his ſinne, if this doctrine of reprobation be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God forbid; he that prohibits and puniſhes ſinne, doth not procure and cauſe it; let no man ſay, (ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi>) <hi>When he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, neither tempteth he any man:</hi> But every man is tempted, when he is drawne away of his owne luſt, and inticed. Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and commeth from the father of lights, &amp;c. Neither doth the contrary follow from the doctrine that hath been taught: God doth deny his grace to ſome, but he doth not infuſe corruption or ſin, into any; and therefore cannot be charged, as the author of ſinne: the deniall of grace is the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of ſinne, but not the cauſe: between the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102519:130"/>and the conſequent, there is no caſuality: the Sunne not giving his light, there followes darkneſſe on the earth, yet is the ſunne the cauſe of light, not of darkneſſe: God witholding his grace, and ſpirit, from his creature there followes ſinne, and wickedneſſe in the creature: yet is God the cauſe of the grace, and holineſſe, of the creature, not of ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is in it: I ſtand not long on theſe things, it is my purpoſe to teach, not to diſpute, and theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities heaped upon this doctrine, ariſe as directly and in as full force againſt the opinion of the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; let them ſee how to ſalve themſelves, and the ſame plaiſter, will ſerve us, as well as them.</p>
               <p>Againe, they ſay, it is injuſtice, to hate where there is no ſinne; hatred ſignifies; Firſt, to love one leſſe then another (as hath been ſhewed.) Secondly, to decree. Thirdly, to denounce. Fourthly, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute puniſhment. In the firſt ſenſe, it is no injuſtice, to hate without reſpect to ſinne; we may, (and why then may not God) prefer one thing before another, both being of the ſame goodneſſe? and in this act, the thing preferred is loved, the other hated: In the three laſt exceptions, there is no injuſtice; for God doth not decree, or denounce, or execute puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſave onely againſt ſinners, and for ſinne: Take it in a ſimilitude; if a free Prince, of two beggers, advances the one to riches, and honour, and deſerts the other, and ſuffers him in his beggery, there is no injuſtice in it: If <hi>Pharoah</hi> reſtore his Butler and hang up his Baker, both having offended, there is no injuſtice in it: If God ſet a ſpeciall affection,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102519:130"/>on ſome of his creatures which he denies to others: why ſhould any repine? is thy eie evill, becauſe I am good? No ſay they, but God ſhould not be made the author of mans ſinne, and miſery: there was ſomething in man that did provoke God to paſſe him over, and for which he did appoint him to wrath. I anſwer, is this the thing you deſire? agree then on this, that God is the cauſe of mans grace, and glory; that there was nothing in man, that did move God, to chuſe him, and predeſtinate him to life: how like you this? This doctrine will not down with theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters, they as much miſlike, that Gods will ſhould be taught the cauſe of grace, as of ſinne, and would have a man the framer of his owne fortune: a mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection grounded on his faith, as his reprobation on his infidelity: we know who anſwered the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who made thee to differ from thy brother? with, <hi>Ego diſcrevi meipſum,</hi> I made my ſelfe to differ from my brother: this is aimed at, though they bluſh openly to profeſſe it; it is but a pretence to cover this that they ſtand upon ſo much, that by this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decree, God is made the author of ſinne, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: we only ſay with the Scripture, that God to manifeſt the power of his wiſedome, juſtice, grace, mercy, and other Attributes, choſe ſome to life, and paſſed over other ſome: If it be demanded, why he choſe thoſe whom he choſe, and not the other whom he paſſed over? The anſwer is, becauſe it pleaſed him: there was no excellency in <hi>Peter</hi> above <hi>Iudas,</hi> which ſhould incline God to elect <hi>Peter,</hi> when he paſſed over <hi>Iudas;</hi> nor wickedneſſe in <hi>Iudas,</hi> which
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102519:131"/>was not in <hi>Peter,</hi> which might provoke God to paſſe over or reprobate <hi>Iudas,</hi> when he choſe <hi>Peter:</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. For the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not being yet borne &amp;c. we ſay, that they whom God paſſed over, ſinned and continued in ſin, and for ſinne, were decreed to be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments; and though ſinne be not the cauſe of reprobation, yet is there no man damned, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be damned, but for ſinne: Oh! but it ſeems contrary to the goodneſſe of God, thus to hate, or paſſe over any: I anſwer, God is good, and doth good, and the whole earth is full of his goodneſſe: but it muſt be conſidered, that the goodneſſe of God, doth not binde him to communicate to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all that goodneſſe of which the creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and he can beſtow without impeachment of his juſtice: who dare deny, but God might have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed the Apoſtate Angels, that kept not their firſt eſtate, that they ſhould not have fallen? he did it not, was this contrary to goodneſſe? God diſpences not amongſt men equally, riches, honours, friends, &amp;c. is it contrary to his goodneſſe; it is ſufficient, that there is no creature, (much leſſe no man,) which is not abundantly ſatisfied with the fruites of Gods goodneſſe, in ſome kinde or other; it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that this goodneſſe, ſhould in the ſame kinde, and meaſure, be extended unto all: God is a moſt free agent, is not bound to any; that we have any thing, it is his bounty; we have no cauſe to complaine, we have no more, but be thankfull, we have ſo much: it is Gods great goodneſſe to ſome, that he hath looked
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102519:131"/>on them in a low eſtate, and paſſed by them in time of love, and drawne them to himſelfe, and prepared for them grace, and glory; and that he hath not done, ſo much for all, is no detraction from his goodneſſe. But why ſhould God paſſe over anger? Why doſt thou diſpute with God? He hath done it becauſe he would, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. He hath done it for himſelfe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. In a great houſe ſome veſſels, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. And why ſhould they repine at this? I demand this of them? If God hath decreed all beaſts of the earth, to ſlaughter, for the nouriſhment of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury to the beaſts; Why may he not decree men to deſtruction, for his owne glory, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to man? is not God the abſolute Lord, as well of men as of beaſts? might not he who made thee a man, have made thee a beaſt? ſhall he loſe his right of diſpoſing of thee, becauſe he hath made thee a man? is not? ought not, man to be as much ſubject to his glory, as the beaſts are to mans pleaſure, or nouriſhment? I conclude, we learne by the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this divine Attribute, to keepe our ſelves from being intangled in the erroneous doctrine of Pelagianiſme, the very deſtruction of all true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and piety, of all ſound comfort, and peace, as I might ſhew at large; but of this uſe at this time ſo farre.</p>

               <p>FRom the goodneſſe of God, I have ſhewed on the one ſide his love, his grace, his mercy; and on the other ſide, his juſtice, his anger, his hatred: all of which, are backed, and aſſiſted by his power; and therefore in the next place, the next Attribute we are to ſpeake of, is the power of God; and before we come to that, we are to adde a uſe or two more, to the doctrin that was delivered of the hatred of God; the uſe is thus much.</p>

                  <q>To this I anſwer directly, no man knowes the counſell of the Lord; and for any thing I know, that is true, that ſome ſtand ſo much on, that every man is bound to beleeve, that he himſelfe is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, rather then rejected; yet a man may know, whether he be in the eſtate of election or no: how is that? if a man be not in the eſtate of grace, but in the eſtate of infidelity, if he be in the hardneſſe of his heart, and in the blindneſſe of his minde, and be in a benummed conſcience, to make no care of ſin, and to conclude with wicked men, if I be elected, I ſhall be ſaved, do what I will; but if I be reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I ſhall be damned, let me live never ſo holy; that man is not yet in the eſtate of election: when a man heares his ſin reproved, and is not bettered by it, but ſpurnes againſt the reprover, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profe; this is a fearefull ſigne of reprobation: I ſay, let every man examine himſelf; becauſe if this be the night that God ſhall take thee way, (if thou be in infidelity and the more thou heareſt, the worſe thou art,) what ſhall become of thee? therefore look to thy ſelf, leſt thou die, as the moſt do; and ſo in the eſtate with the moſt. I ſhut up this; if any man finde ſoftneſſe of heart, ſo that he ſorrowes, becauſe he cannot ſorrow; if a man finde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hatred of ſinne, love of righteouſneſſe, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of ſpirit, purity of heart, &amp;c. that man may aſſure himſelf, that he is not in the eſtate of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and he is to magnifie God, and to worke
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102519:133"/>out his owne ſalvation with feare and trembling.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. <q>A third Uſe is this, If God hath ſhewed this mercy to any, and given them this favour, they have cauſe to rejoyce herein, not onely in reſpect of the greatneſſe of it, but becauſe they are but few, to whom it is given: <hi>Haman</hi> rejoyced becauſe he was bid to the Queenes feaſt, and none but he: how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſhould men value this mercy; that wheras there are but few to whom God ſhewes this mercy, they ſhould be of that number: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of this man that ſhal be ſaved, and of thoſe that periſh, ſaith, they are by nature both miſerable alike. Therefore if whilſt this man abides in his miſery, God be more mercifull to thee that art ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; be not high minded, but feare, and glorifie God, and pitty others, and be thankfull to God, for thy ſelfe: doth God actually puniſh none, but when they are wicked? then let no man, when he is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, accuſe God, but blame himſelfe; for God puniſheth no man, but for his owne ſinnes. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation there are two things, the decree, and the execution: of the decree, is no cauſe, but the will of God: the execution is alwayes for ſinne; he never puniſheth any but for ſinne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay unto me, If God have decreed it, a man cannot chooſe but ſinne: and as he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>what ſhall a man doe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> if his will be not reſiſted, why doth he complaine? I anſwer, Gods fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is no cauſe of the evill; for what if he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102519:133"/>it, and fore-know it; that was no cauſe of it: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> concerning that objection of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he could not be converted by the miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did fore-ſee he would not; anſwers, that God did fore-ſee this; but (ſaith he) the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, did not compell him to be wicked, but he was wicked voluntarily. To ſhut up this; God doth not infuſe any evill into men, but denying them grace, they of their owne nature, neceſſarily fall into ſinne, and therefore are juſtly condemned, and no man can accuſe him, as ignorant fooliſh men doe; no cauſe ſhall be laid upon God, but as the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> hath it, None hath deceived thee, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe, O Iſrael! but thy ſalvation is of me. And ſo much ſhall ſuffiſe for the Hatred of God.</p>
               <p>To explane the power of God; the Grecians to expreſſe it, uſe theſe two words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that the Latines call <hi>Domini,</hi> or <hi>poteſtatem,</hi> and this <hi>potentiam,</hi> that is to ſay Dominion, or right, and power, or might. In the firſt place, we will ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dominion or right, and therefore we have choſen this Text: and the Queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Dominion of God, or of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a communicable Attribute, whereby he is firſt and chiefe abſolute, and moſt free Lord over all, and over ſome more ſpecially then others. To open this: This power is given to God, that it might be knowne, that whatſoever God doth by his might and ſtrength, he hath right to doe it: he doth it not as tyrants, but as a juſt Lord. I ſay, this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102519:134"/>Attribute, becauſe there is the ſhadow of it in man. This power is attributed to God, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.26. <hi>Oh Lord God of our Fathers! art not thou the God of all power? &amp;c.</hi> in this caſe we may ſee that which is applyed to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 16.15. he is called the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.14. The next thing, we ſay he is chiefe; for he receives not his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion from any other, but of him others have that power that they have: therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pro</hi> 8.15. <hi>By me Kings reigne.</hi> Againe, he is free Lord, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> and in the 18. verſ. <hi>he will harden whom he will:</hi> and in the 20. verſ. <hi>who art thou that wilt call him to judgement?</hi> yet further, over ſome more then others, for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. as he is the Saviour of all, but eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve: ſo he is Lord of all, but eſpecially of his redeemed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Aske of me, and I will give thee the heathen, &amp;c.</hi> if he give them to his Sonne, he was Lord over them himſelfe; eſpecially over thoſe that are of the Church. And this is the explication of the firſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is ſuch a Dominion attributed to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is creator and poſſeſſour of all: firſt, he is creator, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. That the creation of all was from him, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. <hi>He is the faithfull creator:</hi> thereupon the name <hi>Ichovah</hi> is given to him; he that hath a being of himſelfe, and gives being to the creatures; the creator hath ſtill power over the creatures. As creator, ſo poſſeſſour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. when he made all things, he kept a right unto himſelfe; and though he had given the earth to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102519:134"/>the children of men, yet the right of poſſeſſion he keepes to himſelfe: therefore dominion may well be attributed to him.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid that he is firſt and chiefe Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For that his power is eternall, Chriſt teaches to acknowledge it in his prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. <hi>thine is the kingdome, power and glory, for ever and ever:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this power is eternall, it hath neither begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſucceſſion, nor ending. If any ſay unto me, How ſhould that be, that this power ſhould be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſeeing the things that were created, were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, he created things in time, but his power was before time; God is nothing, but one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and this power was eternall, like himſelfe; and therefore the firſt and chiefe Lord.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay you, that he is the moſt abſolute, and free Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he may uſe all that he hath made at his owne pleaſure, without let of any other; for the ſalvation of his own, and the deſtruction of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for this is to be abſolute Lord, when one hath a power over all things to doe as he pleaſeth, &amp; hath no ſuperiour either to call him to account, or hinder him. God is of ſuch power, he may do what he liſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controle, or hindering. This appeares firſt in man, for whom he made all creatures, he may doe what he will with him; he might make them, as he made them, no man can call him to account. Firſt, for the body, he may make the body perfect, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102519:135"/>crooked or ſtraight, and who ſhall ſay, Why madeſt thou me ſo? for his eſtate, he may make ſome poore, and ſome rich; ſo for his ſoule, he may elect whom he will, and call whom he will, and juſtifie whom he will; he may ſhew to ſome the way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and others not; and who ſhall call him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it? and ſo for gifts, they are diſtributed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will. Finally, in all other creatures; he ſets the Sunne in the firmament, and gives him his courſe, to runne, and he can bid it ſtand ſtill: and ſo for fire, and water; he makes water ſave his own people, and drowne his enemies: he can make the fire to conſume <hi>Sodom,</hi> and to ſave his owne children.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doe you ſay, that he hath power over ſome more then others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he hath power over ſome by right of redemption, and ſpirituall marriage: he hath a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all by right of creation, but ſpeciall power over ſome by right of redemption, becauſe he hath redeemed ſome by the blood of his Sonne, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>you are not your owne, you are bought with a prace:</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth what price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>we are not redeemed with ſilver and gold, but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of the Lambe:</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it is ſaid, thou haſt redeemed us from among all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Nations. There is another ſpirituall right, and that is by ſpirituall marriage, <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.22. we read it <hi>although I was a husband to them,</hi> or as <hi>Iunius</hi> reads it, <hi>ſhould I continue to be a husband to them:</hi> when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath thus redeemed them by the blood of his Sonne, and married them to himſelfe, he hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102519:135"/>right to ſome more then to others. Now to come to the Uſes of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The firſt is this: there is not, nor can be any injuſtice in God, to diſpoſe as he will of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: will he make his creature faire or deformed? will he make his creature with one eye? will he make his creature to want a limbe? will he make this man a King, and that man a ſlave? no injuſtice in God; Why? he is the Lord over all: it is not injuſtice, for he is Lord over all. I wonder at the wrangling wits of ſome, calling God to an account, why he ſhould make one man faire, &amp; another deformed? and why he ſhould chooſe one man, and refuſe another, and make ſome rich, and others poore? Why ſhould any man call God to account for theſe? ſeeing he is abſolute Lord: we conclude with that, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. Seeing you know theſe things, take heed brethren that you be not plucked away, with the error of the wicked, by theſe whiſpering ſpirits, which goe up and downe. And ſo I end this Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This teaches us, that if any man will have all creatures to doe him good, he muſt labour to have God on his ſide, who can command all thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: As the Centurian ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.18. I command whom I will; God can much more ſay to every thing, doe this, and it doth it: therefore every man ſhould pray to God, to have him on his ſide; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Iacob</hi> is afraid of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and had cauſe to feare, for he was told, that <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt him with 400. men; yet he remembred that God is the abſolute Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.11. he betakes himſelfe to prayer; <hi>Oh
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102519:136"/>deliver me from the hands of my brother:</hi> yet in the next chapter, <hi>Eſau</hi> comes and faunes upon <hi>Iacob:</hi> God had ſo changed his heart: therefore every man after this ſort, is to flye unto God by prayer, for he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lord. If men will have helpe, as <hi>Iacob</hi> had, they muſt uſe meanes as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, and ſeeke unto God by prayer. The heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord; as a boat upon the waters is eaſily tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an oare, ſo God can turne the heart of Kings at his pleaſure: when <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.7. and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſophat</hi> were friends, then my horſes as thy horſes, &amp;c. ſo we may ſay, if a man be at peace with God, then all the creatures of God are for him, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.15. If a mans wayes pleaſe the Lord, he will make his enemies to be at peace with him: then this teaches every man to be at peace with God, and make him his friend: men would have every thing to be good for them, nay, they thinke, the things that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy are good for them, but they are deceived; it is a great anger of God, when he ſuffers men to goe on and proſper, and doth not ſhew his anger, when a man walkes not in his wayes: all ſhall worke for the good of thoſe that love God, and are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpoſe; but all ſhall worke for the evill of thoſe that goe on in ſin, and bleſſe themſelves in their flouriſhing eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obje.</hi> But ſome may ſay, who hath more enemies, then thoſe who are in league with God? Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, <hi>In the world, you ſhall have affliction:</hi> how is this true?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, they want their love, and have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102519:136"/>their hatred; but it is when their hatred is better then their love; if their love were better for them, they ſhould have it; but God ſees their love would be evill to them, therefore they are without it: Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> explanes that place, in 25. <hi>Gen. The elder ſhall ſerve the yonger;</hi> it may carry this kind of alluſion, that wicked men ſhould ſerve the godly; perſecutors, ſaith he, are ſervants to the godly; how? in the ſame maner as ſire is ſervant to the mettals, as the Oven and the mill are ſervants to the Corne; now then, the fire is ſervant to the mettals, to purge out the droſſe; and the Oven, and the Mill, is ſervant to the Corne, to grind, and bake them, &amp;c. So the wicked is ſervant to the godly, becauſe he purges, and makes him fitter for God: ſo that all theſe things, by Gods power, are made for their good; If God be abſolute, &amp;c. this teaches every man, that they muſt labour to ſerve him; every one, in what condition ſoever, be they never ſo much above others, be they high, or low, for he is Lord, therefore they ought to feare him, and ſerve him: Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, power appertaines to him, that is Lord and maſter; doth it ſo? then eſpecially it belongs to God: <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I be a maſter, where is my feare?</hi> So to every one, if he be Lord of all, where then is his ſervice? none can ſay, he is not ſubject to him; when the Lord did deliver his law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. It was thus, with a preface, I am the Lord thy God, therefore keepe my lawes, whatſoever I command thee; this is that which every man ſhould performe unto him, and ſay with himſelfe, God is my Lord, and I his ſervant, therefore I muſt endeavour ſtill, to do him
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102519:137"/>ſervice; every one ought to performe this unto him, and to obey him in all things: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>I had reſpect unto all thy commandements;</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith; he that ſaith to thee, thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultry, ſaith alſo, thou ſhalt not ſteale, &amp;c. <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaith, no ſervant when he is commanded, may chuſe in what he will obey, if he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his maſter; he that doth what he liſt, he doth not his maſters will, but his owne: he that will obey God, muſt not doe what he liſt, but what God will have him, becauſe he is abſolute Lord: and this is that duty that is required of us; to give him obedience in all his commandements; and this ſhall comfort us, that we have obeyed and ſerved him here, and we ſhall have glory, and happineſſe hereafter.</p>

               <p>The next queſtion is:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the power of God, or of the Divine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a communicable Attribute, whereby he is able to doe all things what he will, and many things that he will not: this muſt be unfoulded; the thing that is deſcribed is power; the Maſter of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Phyloſophie tells us, there is a double power; one paſſive, and another active: paſſive, by which a thing is able to ſuffer ſome change, in ſubſtance, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; when we ſpeake of God, we may not think of this power, becauſe God is Immutable without chang; <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. he therfore having perfection, cannot change, nor ſuffer in ſubſtance, or in accidents, which he hath not, and therefore he cannot die, nor deny himſelfe; and this doth eſtabliſh his power, as after I will ſhew: Active power, we confeſſe is to be given to God, not that God hath accidents in his Eſſence, but we ſpeake after mans capacity; and hereof this place is meant: So, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. in the deſcription of God, he is ſaid to be ſtrong; So in the fowrth verſe, of the ninth chapter of <hi>Iob,</hi> that we have read for this time, he is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength: the former part of this chapter, is but a deſcription of the power of God: and Chriſt hath taught us, <hi>Mat</hi> 6.13. thine is the power, that is, this active power that we have deſcribed, we ſay, that it is a communicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute: for the reaſon we have before ſpoken of; The next, that he is able to doe all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will; hereupon he is ſaid to be omnipotent, whatſoever he will, whatſoever he pleaſe that he can
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102519:138"/>doe; this power admits another diſtinction, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther active, or abſolute; active is that by which he hath, and doe whatſoever he will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. <hi>Looke what it pleaſeth him, that hath he done in heaven, alſo in the earth.</hi> And ſo alſo, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.11. <hi>He works all things, according to the counſell of his owne will:</hi> and by his actuall power, he workes, ſometimes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, and ſometimes mediatly; immediatly by his word, and beck; and ſo he doth what he will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of the creature: mediatly, when he uſes the miniſtry of the creatures, for the working of what he will: and this active power of his, is as large as his will, and is limited by his will; he can do whatſoever he will, and what he will not, that he doth not: hereupon is that Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeakes, Gods will is to doe, if he will, it is his deed: <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> makes a difference between the will of God, and the power of God, (if there be any) Gods power is more large then his will. The next, he can do, what he doth not; and what he will not, he hath power to do it: this is called abſolute power, by which he can do all things: heerupon is that which Chriſt hath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.37. <hi>There is nothing unpoſsible to the Lord. Ephe.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Iob</hi> 4.2. <hi>I know thou conſt doe all things:</hi> This power is not limited by his will, he is able to doe more then he will; and whatſoever he hath done, he could doe it better, after a ſort if he would, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33. <hi>I could pray unto my father, and he would give me more then twelve legions of Angels:</hi> And yet Chriſt, would neither pray for them, nor the father give them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. <hi>He can raiſe up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102519:138"/>of ſtones,</hi> that which he never did, yet thus the Scriptures ſhewes, that his power, is beyond his will; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Who is able to doe exceeding abundantly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that we are able to aske, or thinke:</hi> who would call it into queſtion, but that God, if he would, could have made many, and alſo other worlds? nay, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men more as there are: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that he could, and can doe many things, that he will not doe; ſo that this is manifeſt, that he cannot onely do all things, that he will, but alſo what he will not, &amp;c. but yet we muſt obſerve, that ſome things, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are ſaid to be impoſſible, and it is not abſurd; neither can any offend in ſaying, that there are ſome things, unpoſſible for God to do, even by his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power: firſt, there are ſome things impoſſible to be done in themſelves, and their owne nature; of which number, are thoſe things, that imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; the affirming, and denying of the ſame thing, in the ſame time, in the ſame reſpect, is called a contradiction; for inſtance, to affirme that <hi>Peter,</hi> lives and breathes, at one and the ſame time, and yet to ſay, <hi>Peter</hi> doth not live, and breath; to ſay, it is light, and to deny it is light; to ſay the world was created, and not created, theſe are contradictions; then we apply this, God cannot make contradictions true; he cannot make the world, and then make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have been; when he hath created it, he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, but yet it had a being. &amp;c. Secondly, we ſay that there are ſome things impoſſible, not becauſe they are impoſſible to be done, but for God to doe them; the evill of ſinne is impoſſible for the creator
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102519:139"/>to doe; but for the creature, it is poſſible; to cat, to ſleep, to walke it is impoſſible for God to doe: to the like purpoſe, the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. ſaith, <hi>God that cannot deny himſelf.</hi> 1 <hi>Titus</hi> 2. <hi>God cannot lie:</hi> man can lie, man can deny himſelf: <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Thou art of pure eies, &amp;c.</hi> that is, thou canſt not ſee ſinne, goe unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; men may, but God cannot: theſe things are poſſible to the weakneſſe, and to the infirmities of man, but they are not poſſible to God: and thus I have explaned this deſcription, of the power of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is power Attributed to God, or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he can make, mar, and deſtroy. Secondly, he can bring light, out of darkneſſe; good, out of evill. Thirdly, he gives to every creature, what power ſoever it hath; therefore doe we juſtly attribute power to God: to explane theſe; firſt, he makes, and deſtroies with his word, which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt power in the world cannot doe, for that muſt uſe the power of others; but God if he ſpeak the word, it ſhall be done, it is out of his wiſdome, and goodneſſe, to man and not out of any neceſſity to himſelf, that he uſeth the helpe of the creature in working; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth will, he can doe it with his beck; therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, that power muſt be attributed to him. The next reaſon is, power is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him, becauſe he can bring light, out of darkneſſe; good, out of evill: he hath taught men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that art, that they can make good out of naturall evill; but out of morall evill, they cannot; none have
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102519:139"/>this power, to bring good out of ſinne, but He: Saint <hi>Anguſtine</hi> ſaith, that what is done beſides his will, is not done againſt his will, in that he ſuffered it to be done, and he never ſuffers againſt his will: and that he would never ſuffer evill to be done, but that out of his omnipotency, he would make good come out of that evill; ſo it commeth to paſſe, that though a thing, be done contrary to the will of God, yet the will of God is done in it; as <hi>Iudas</hi> in the betraying of his maſter; the act as he did it, was contrary to Gods will, yet it is ſaid, that he did nothing, but it was afore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the will, and counſell of God; therefore po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is to be attributed to God. The laſt reaſon, there is no power that any creature hath, but they have it from him; great is the power, that is given to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to Angels, to men, <hi>Iob</hi> 40. <hi>When Iob ſpake to God &amp;c.</hi> The Lord ſaith unto him, hath man the ſtrength of theſe creatures, the <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> that ſcorn the Armies, where had they it? I have given them it, ſaith God; the power that Angels have, we read that one Angel ſlew an hundred foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and five thouſand of the enemies of God, in one night; then what power is he of, that gives ſuch power to one of one kinde of creatures? therefore po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is juſtly attributed to God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doe you ſay that God is abſolute, to doe whatſover he will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe his power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: for ſeeing God is infinite, his power muſt be infinite; for indeed the power of God, is nothing elſe but the Eſſence of God, and the Eſſence of God
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102519:140"/>is infinite: Gods power is infinite in three reſpects: infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in nature, in effect, and intention: infinite in nature, becauſe it is Gods Eſſence; for as an infinite power cannot poſſibly be in an infinite ſubject, ſo an infinite ſubject cannot poſſibly be without infinite power: infinite in effects, the power of every thing is meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the effects: for inſtance, the Sunne is more powerfull then all the other ſtars, becauſe it doth produce more effects in the things below, then all the ſtars; and if the ſunne could produce infinite effects, it ſhould be infinite: now God is infinite in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, becauſe he can doe infinite things; &amp;c. as in creating, he could have created more worlds; indeed his power is in the operation limited by his will, but he hath a greater power in himſelf, infinite in effects: Thirdly, infinite in intention, the School-men tell us, that Gods favour is infinite, extenſively, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveſy; extenſively, becauſe it can extend it ſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite effects: intenſively, becauſe it could be more powerfull in every worke, then actuall it is: and thus God is able to doe above all we are able to think.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid, that God is able to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is abſolutely poſsible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe ſome things are abſolutely impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible to be done, as things that are repugnant to the perfect wiſdome, and purity, and goodneſſe of Gods nature; and yet it is not want of power, not to be able to do theſe: for inſtance, as we ſaid before, he cannot doe the workes of a naturall body, he cannot eat, nor drinke, ſleep, &amp;c. why? becauſe theſe things are repugnant to the perfection of his nature; for theſe are workes of weakneſſe, and of a naturall body, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102519:140"/>not workes of an infinite Eſſence; he cannot change, becauſe he is infinite, and eternall; he cannot die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is life it ſelfe: it is the greateſt power, not to be able to doe theſe things: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the power of God is not diminiſhed, when we ſay he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die, nor deny himſelfe; the reaſon is, becauſe if he could do theſe things, he ſhould be of leſſe power, for theſe come from weakneſſe, not from power; and the power of God appeares in doing whatſoever he will, not in doing that he will not, or that cannot be done for the infirmity thereof; God therefore is able to doe, whatſoever is abſolutely poſſible: we may explane this further: God cannot doe this, or that: why? becauſe it is contrary to his truth, to make a man an Aſſe at the ſame time, is contrary to truth; to make a body circumſcribed, and not circumſcribed, is to make that which is faulty, true; theſe things are impoſſible for him: if any man ſhall ſay, if God be omnipotent, let him make theſe things that he hath made, not to be made; this is to ſay, (ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>) let God not be true: and this is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God is faithfull;</hi> the father there tells us, that whatſoever is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either of God, or the creature, that is abſolutely impoſſible to be done by divine power; for it were weakneſſe to do ſuch things, he cannot lie, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to his nature: Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, God cannot doe unjuſt things, becauſe he is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt juſtice; ſo alſo the ſunne cannot make darkneſſe, becauſe it is light it ſelfe: Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, what is impoſſible for him to doe, that can doe all things;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102519:141"/>but that which he is not willing to doe? all things then that can ſtand with the nature of God, he can doe? whatſoever is repugnant to his nature, that he cannot doe; not onely becauſe it is no power to doe them, but the greateſt power that can be, is never to be able to doe them.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine thus conceived, will make a man able to defend the power of God, againſt all the idle objections that fleſh and blood can make againſt it: there is nothing that can be brought, but it is eaſily anſwered, by ſome one part of this deſcription that I havedelivered: if you looke to be grounded in theſe things, ye ſhall be able to informe both your ſelves and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Here is great matter of comfort to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: what a comfort is this, that they being once in the eſtate of grace, ſuch as God hath eſpecially fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, actually calling them and aſſuring them of his mercy, they cannot fall away from that eſtate? ſay the old Pelagians and new Arminians what they wil; their calling, their grace is of the power of God, and God is able to keepe them. God is able to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will: I ſay, he can doe it, if he will; and he will doe it, for he hath called them, and given them grace without themſelves: and promiſeth by <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> 52.40. that he will marry them to himſelfe, with an everlaſting covenant, that he will never turne away from them to doe them good. But how ſhall this be made good? Here is the aſſurance; He is able to doe whatſoever he will, and none can ever faile, whom God will uphold. Indeede, if God will change his
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102519:141"/>will, and looſe his power, a man that is called might fall away; but who ſhall make him to faile? <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, that God hath two hands, one latitude, and the other fortitude; the one is rich in mercy, the other ability in power: by the one hand, he gives bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and by the other, he powerfully defends what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he hath given. He that thinkes ſuch a man may fall away, he cuts off, as it were, one of Gods armes: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have beleeved:</hi> we have beleeved on him that is omnipotent: whilſt we have his word and power, we are ſure; not that we ſhould preſume and grow deſperate, but that we ſhould worke out our ſalvation with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; and labour to ſee how weake we are in our ſelves: and yet when we looke up to the power of God, ſhould triumph and rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Is God thus?</p>
               <p>This teaches us to labour to feare this great God: Who will not feare thee, oh King of Nations? <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.10. are you ſtronger then God? who art thou then that dareſt provoke God to his face, and pleaſe thy ſelf in ſinne? if he were a weake God, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt make thy party good with him, it were ſomewhat; but when he is a ſpirituall God, of ſuch might and power to avenge himſelfe; how ſhould this worke feare in thee? two evils draw men into ſinne, and are occaſions of much evill; preſuming on Gods mercy, and fearing mans power; theſe two ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> are a cauſe of much evill: many periſh by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, others by fearing the power of men, becauſe they can kill the body; how ſhall men be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102519:142"/>theſe? in few words, to reſiſt theſe poyſoned darts, conſider of the power of God; when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt he is mercifull and gracious, thinke withall, that he is powerfull and juſt, that by preſuming thou ſinne not againſt him: if he were a God of patience without power, then a man might doe what he liſt: againe, if a man take this God to be omnipotent, then he will not feare him that can kill the body: when theſe ſtand not together, the power of men and the power of God, then feare the great power of God, which is able to take thee body and ſoule, and throw thee to hell. And thus much for this Attribute.</p>

               <p>THE knowledge of God, as was propounded, was to be ſought in his written Word, which taught us not onely that there is a God, and that there is but one onely God, but alſo what that God is: the deſcription of whom, out of the Scriptures you have heard, that he is one Eſſence, moſt perfect, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102519:142"/>into three perſons, &amp;c. to the perfection of God, belongs all the Attributes, as you have heard: of all the proper attributes of God, we have ſpoken at large; there be other attributes, which the learned call Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall; there are but few of them, but may well be reduced under theſe.</p>
               <p>We are now to goe on with the laſt thing of our deſcription; that is, that God is diſtinguiſhed into three perſons: for the ground of handling the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we have made choyce of this Text, that <hi>there are three that beare record in heaven:</hi> This myſtery is onely to be found in the word of God, and ſo onely knowne of the Church of God, which hath the true word of God, and the Church hath endeavoured to ſpeake as plaine as it can in ſuch a myſtery. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a ſpeech of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who wrote a booke of the Trinity: of this great and excellent point, we muſt ſpeake with modeſty, and feare, we ought to heare with great attention; for where unity of the Trinity is to be ſhewed, ſaith the Father, men erre moſt dangerouſly, and nothing is enquired with more difficulty, nor found with more profit: ſo that we muſt have great care to endevour to underſtand it: ſo farre as it is revealed, God hath revealed it, and it is ſinfull, and damnable negligence not to ſeeke after that which is revealed by God: but let us labour for humility, that we looke not into this myſtery further then is needfull. The weakeneſſe of man can looke on the beames of the Sunne, but not on the body of the Sunne; ſo man in this caſe, if he looke too farre, may loſe his eyes. The men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:102519:143"/>4.6. had the hand of God upon them, when they looked into the Arke of God: will it not therefore follow, that we muſt be ſober in this, ſeeing God hath really manifeſted his anger againſt them in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Hence comes the blaſphemy of Hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have looked into this myſtery further then is meet; therefore we will labour with feare to keepe our ſelves within the bounds of modeſty and ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: much time may be ſpent in explaning of words, as of unity, and trinity, and Eſſence, &amp;c. but I thinke that our time ſhall be more profitablely ſpent, if we apply our ſelves rather to the matter, then to explane words: once take this for a trueth, and as a thing granted, and as a ground that will hold; That as it was with <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, he gave names to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beaſt, ſo in this caſe, the Church may give names and uſe expreſſions of her owne, to declare this great myſtery, without juſt offence to any; and therefore now to come to the matter. This is a great and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thing to beſpoken of. That there are three perſons, and that they are three diſtinct perſons: for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this myſtery the better, we muſt firſt deſcribe what a perſon is, and then ſhew why they are ſuch.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is a perſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, It is a ſubſtance ſubſiſting of it ſelfe, undivideable, incommunicable, living, underſtanding, and willing: of which deſcription, to open every word briefely, becauſe it is but an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to that which followes: Firſt, it is a ſubſtance ſubſiſting; I doe not ſay that it is a ſubſtance barely, but ſubſiſting with ſuch a property, and in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102519:143"/>that it cannot be another then it is; for inſtance, <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> are two perſons, they are both ſubſtances ſubſiſting; but <hi>Peter</hi> is in ſuch a manner <hi>Peter,</hi> as he cannot be <hi>Paul;</hi> and I ſay, after this manner a perſon is a ſubſtance ſubſiſting. Secondly, by it ſelfe; ſo it is not an attribute, nor part of another thing. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſubſiſteth by another thing, for it is not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in it ſelfe, but in another; every accident is in ſome ſubſtance, as white and blacke. Againe, it is not part of another, for that which is part of another, doth not ſubſiſt in it ſelfe, but in the whole of which it is part; for inſtance, the matter whereof a man is made in the wombe of a woman, ſo long as it is part of the woman, is no perſon, till it have in it a ſoule, and then ceaſeth to be a part: and ſo the humanity of Chriſt hath ſubſiſtance in the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, and is no perſon of it ſelfe, becauſe it hath no ſubſiſtence of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Individuall, that is a particular; it is one in number.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Incommunicable, it is not Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, as the Eſſence is: as the nature of things is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to all that are of that kind, the nature of man is communicable to all men, the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells is communicable to all Angells; ſo the Eſſence, and nature of the divinity, is communicable to all the perſons, but the perſons are not ſo amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; therefore we ſay it is incommunicable.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we ſay it is living, for that which is without life cannot be a perſon; a Book or a Board cannot be a perſon, neither is every thing that hath life a perſon,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102519:144"/>and therefore I adde underſtanding, and willing; that is ſo living, that it underſtands and wills; thus a Beaſt, and Trees have life, but they want underſtanding and reaſon, therefore they cannot be a perſon; ſo now you have the deſcription of a perſon.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How many ſuch perſons bee there in the Diety?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Three; the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt: we muſt prove that theſe three be ſubſtances, &amp;c. It is manifeſt, firſt in generall, the Father is a ſubſtance, ſubſiſting by himſelf, individuable, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, ſo is the Sonne, and ſo is the holy Ghoſt: therefore there are three perſons in the Trinity: <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Let us goe down and confound their language:</hi> let us goe is more then one, and God doth not ſpeake to the Angels by way of conſultation, let us, but of command, go you; and in the eight verſe, it is ſaid, the Lord confounds their Language: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord,</hi> &amp;c. three holies is ſpoken of three perſons, applied to one that is called the Lord, that is one Eſſence; that this is meant of three perſons, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; it is granted by all, that the Father is one, and then the Sonne is another: <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.34.40. <hi>The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Prophet is alledged, and there uſed as applied to Chriſt;</hi> thus ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Eſai</hi> ſpake of him when he ſaw his glory, therefore the Sonne is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the ſame is alſo for the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25.26. <hi>Well ſaith the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> that which is ſpoken of the Father in the old Teſtament, the holy Ghoſt applies to the Sonne, and to himſelfe in the new, therefore there are three ſubſtances, &amp;c. my text is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102519:144"/>a manifeſt proofe of this; there are three which, &amp;c. they are not three names, nor three properties, nor three ſeverall words; they are three, that is, three ſubſtances or perſons; three that are ſeverall, that we may manifeſt this a little more, and that particularly. There was never any Heretique that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Father to be God; concerning the ſonne, theſe teſtimonies: <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>Iacob wreſtled with a man,</hi> this ſame man that <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtled withall, was God; ſo ſaith, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.3. that <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtled with God: the text in <hi>Gen.</hi> ſaith it was man; the other text ſaith it was God; but how appeares this, that it was the Sonne, becauſe that the Father never appeared in any ſhape? Againe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> here he is called the word; to this may be aded: <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.28. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am, a perſon ſevered from the Father: Iohn</hi> 17.5. <hi>Now Ftaher Glorifie me with that glory which I had with thee, before the world was;</hi> A perſon ſpeaking to the Father, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Father: Thirdly the holy Ghoſt is a perſon: <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend you another comforter,</hi> here is plainely ſeene, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: he ſpeakes not of comfort, but a comforter: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. the Apoſtle praies, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not onely to God the Father, but alſo to God the Son, of whom grace is deſired, and to the holy Ghoſt, is prayer made; ſo that by theſe Scriptures appeares there are three perſons, living, underſtanding, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What reaſon is there, that there are ſuch three perſons in the Trinity?</hi>
               </p>

Thirdly, becauſe that men in baptiſme, are dedicated unto them all, and make a covenant with them all, as well as with one: we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it thus: firſt, that they are all God; to ſay nothing of the Father, for that is confeſſed of all: it appeares that the Sonne is God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. ſpeaking of the Son, <hi>He is God over all, bleſſed for ever:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>O God thy throne indures for ever!</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, that one ſhall ſuffice: <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3.4.5. The Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> chalenges <hi>Annanias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira, that they had not liedunto men, but unto God;</hi> and then he tells them, that they had lied againſt the holy Ghoſt; ſo then, the holy Ghoſt alſo is God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they all created the world, it appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning, God created the world,</hi> that the father did create the world, will be confeſſed of all: that the Sonne created the world, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the ſame, ſaith, <hi>By him were all things created, whether things viſible;</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. <hi>By him was created, whatſoever was made, and without him, was nothing made, that was made:</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Thou Lord haſt laid the foundations of the world:</hi> That the holy Ghoſt did create, appeares, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>By thy word were the heavens made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth:</hi> ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The ſpirit moved upon the waters.</hi> What is that? as the Hen doth upon her egs, to hatch them, ſo the holy Ghoſt preſerves them: &amp;c. in the 26. verſe, he ſaith, <hi>Let us make man in our Image;</hi> not in the image of Angels, but in the Image of God: now
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102519:145"/>then, if theſe did create the world, and give it a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall being, they muſt needs have a ſubſtantiall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe in baptiſme, men are dedicated unto them all, and make a covenant with them all: they cannot be dedicated to them, that have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.21. <hi>Go, &amp;c. baptiſing them in the name of the father, of the ſon, and boly Ghoſt:</hi> and therefore theſe three muſt needs ſubſiſt by themſelves; and therefore they muſt have all underſtanding, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and are all perſons &amp;c. more particularly we manifeſt it, of theſe that be in queſtion, the ſon and ſpirit: if the father be granted of all, to be God, and a perſon: why is the Son ſet apart by ſome? but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be God, and a diſtinct perſon, by excellent reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the Son did deſcend, and take the nature of man. Secondly, becauſe he is of the ſame Eſſence with the Father. Thirdly, becauſe he ever was, and ſhall be the mediator of his Church. To explane theſe; a meer name, a property, or quality, as heretiques ſay he is, cannot deſcend: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. <hi>Who is he that aſcended, but he alſo that deſcended?</hi> the ſecond perſon did deſcend, the humanity did not; What did he when he was deſcended? he tooke the nature of man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14. The word was made fleſh; that is, it took fleſh to it: for marke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.16. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the children were partakers of fleſh &amp; bloud, therefore he did partake, &amp;c.</hi> in the 16. verſe, <hi>He did not take the nature of Angels, but he tooke the ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> therefore before he was made fleſh, he was a perſon, even before he did deſcend: the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102519:146"/>reaſon, that he is a perſon diſtinct from the Father, is becauſe he is, and ever was, and ſhall be, Mediator of the Church, and the Angel of the Covenant, even before he was made man: we prove it; as ſoone as man ſinned, God was offended; and then man could not be ſaved, without a Mediator; therefore he was the mediator; yet ſo ſtill, that before his incarnation, he was a perſon. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Let us not tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them tempted him;</hi> where he calls us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that then Chriſt was in the wilderneſſe with them, &amp;c. ſo that he was a mediator before his incarnation: <hi>Iob</hi> 13.8. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for ever;</hi> therefore mediator, and then there is but one mediator, and that is the man Chriſt, he is called the Angel of the Covenant: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and therefore he muſt needs be a perſon: and thus I have in particular confirmed this, concerning the Sonne. Now for the holy Ghoſt, he is alſo proved to be a perſon: firſt, becauſe that he did often appear in a viſible ſhape. Secondly, becauſe there are effects attributed to him, which cannot be attributed to any thing, but to a perſon. The firſt of theſe, thus: <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. at the baptiſing of Chriſt, he deſcended upon him, in the ſhape of a Dove: and in the ſecond of <hi>Acts,</hi> He appeared in cloven tongues upon the Apoſtles: and therefore is not a property, or quality, as heretiques teach. Secondly, becauſe that to the holy Ghoſt there are given ſuch effects, ſuch appellations, which cannot be given to any, but ſuch a ſubſtance: for there is given unto him, to know ſecret things, that are to come. Secondly, to determine controverſies,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102519:146"/>to give gifts to men, to pray, to be praied unto, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a petſon, and of a divine perſon. Firſt, that he knowes ſecrets: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 11. The ſpirit knows the ſecret things of God: therefore he muſt needs be a perſon: he did know, and foreſee things, that ſhould be: how appears that? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. The ſpirit ſpeaketh evidently &amp;c. that is, the holy Ghoſt foretells, what ſhall be in the latter times. Secondly, he decrees, and determines, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us: therefore it followes that he is a perſon. Thirdly, gifts are attributed to him; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.23. <hi>The fruits of the ſpirit, are joy, peace, long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, gentleneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>By the ſame ſpirit to one is given, the word of knowledge, and theſe are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, according to his will:</hi> and therefore no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, nor quality, but a perſon, &amp;c. Againe, he helps men to pray, and praies for men: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray as we ought, but the ſpirit helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, he makes ſighs, and groanes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. The fellowſhip of the holy Ghoſt be with you; he that makes praiers for us, helps men to pray, and is praied unto; he cannot be a name, and property, &amp;c. as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques ſay, but a perſon. And ſo I have ſhewed you, the holy Ghoſt is a perſon: I remember one thing now, which I ſhould have given before; a reaſon that I gave, why the Sonne is a perſon; is, becauſe that he was of the ſame nature with the Father, becauſe he is the Son, a ſon begotten of his father; not a created ſonne, but a begotten ſonne: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten &amp;c. Pal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Thou art my ſonne this day have I begotten thee:</hi> ſhewing an everlaſting begetting; as
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102519:147"/>the Sonne is everlaſtingly begotten, ſo the Father e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly begets, ſo that the Sonne, muſt be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſtinct from the Father, in Divinity, and alſo in Humanity, he is the Sonne of God; as God, he is the Sonne of God, begotten of his Father, and ſo of the ſame nature with the Father, and not a name, but a perſon: as man he is the ſonne of God, God the Sonne, is joyned unto the humanity, and therefore Chriſt ſaith, I goe to my Father, and your Father; my Father by nature, your Father by adoption: therefore he muſt be a ſeverall, and diſtinct perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This teacheth us, to confute all Heretiques, as the <hi>Sabellian,</hi> who will have but one perſon, in the Divinity; and for divers reſpects called Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, having no ſeverall being, that the Sonne hath not the ſame Eſſence, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor the holy Ghoſt, the ſame Eſſence with them both: but by this ground you are taught to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor theſe, and the like Hereſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. It teaches thoſe, that have heard this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by faith, to conceive three perſons, as they are delivered unto us: this ſurpaſſes the reaſon of men, and Angels, therefore every man ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know this by faith; and not to rely on ſenſe, and reaſon, but on the word of God: Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, I ſhall ſpeake this boldly, that which I doe not underſtand, I beleeve, that which I cannot conceive, yet I beleeve never the leſſe: and ſo ought every one of us, to labour to beleeve, though we cannot tell how it ſhould be: there is great neceſſity of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this truth, no ſalvation can be, except a man do
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102519:147"/>hold this Trinity: therefore every man ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to beleeve, he muſt walke by faith, and not by ſenſe: it is unpoſſible that the ſhallow conceit of man ſhould be able to finde theſe myſteries, if God had not revealed them, it were as poſſible to empty the Ocean with a ſpoon, as to finde them out: becauſe they are matters of faith, and not of ſenſe; hold faſt that which God hath revealed: no man may goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then God hath revealed, ſo far he muſt goe: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dangerous curuoſity: <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.29. Secret things belong to God, but things revealed to us, &amp;c. that which is manifeſt, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> is ours, becauſe we cannot ſee that which is hid; therefore labour to conceive, ſo far as God hath revealed: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if any man aske, how it may appear, that there are three in one? Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath a pretty ſimilitude, to expreſſe there are three: the Spring, and River, and a portion taken out of theſe, are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, &amp;c. but if any man ſhould aske, what is the Spring? water: what is the River? water: what is the portion taken out? water: come to a Well ſaith he, &amp; fill three cups with water: we can ſay, they are three, but we cannot ſay, that they are three ſeverall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; theſe myſteries being hard, ought to be ſtudied, and praied for: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, give me that I love, what is that? when I ſet my ſelf to know thee, I beſeech thee, give me a heart, that I may know thee, even theſe great myſteries of ſalvation: thus every man ought to pray, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Queſt. <hi>HOw are theſe perſons diſtinguiſhed? or how are theſe three diſtinguiſhed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is, they are three, not divided, but diſtinguiſhed, truely, and really: not eſſentially, but perſonally, and that by their order, properties, and workes I ſay, they are diſtinguiſhed, not divided; there is a double diſtinction of perſons, one is called an eſſentiall diſtinction, then the perſons are ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as they are divided, and there is a perſonall, but not eſſentiall diſtinction; then one perſon is not ſevered from another, becauſe the Eſſence is not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Three perſons of men eſſentially diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are three men; but the perſons of the Trinity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed onely perſonally, are not three Gods, but one. The former three perſons are three men, becauſe their eſſences may be divided, although not in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, yet in the ſpeciall; the latter three perſons, are not three Gods, becauſe their eſſence cannot be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Three men have all one nature, all one humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the generall, but they have not all one nature in the ſpeciall; for the nature of one is not the nature of another: now in this, the reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe that their eſſence is finite, and diviſible; but here, there are three perſons, and cannot be three Gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102519:148"/>their eſſence is infinite and indiviſible: ſo that in the Trinity, there is, as a Father ſpeakes, <hi>alius &amp; alius,</hi> not <hi>aliud &amp; aliud;</hi> that is, there is but one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet many perſons. As the Father is another perſon, but not another thing from the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt another from them both: and this is manifeſtly proved after this manner:</p>
               <p>Three muſt needs be a perſonall diſtinction, they are three witneſſes, (and a witneſſe cannot change his habit, as Hereticks ſay,) yet ſo as they are but one, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God:</hi> the laſt of theſe manifeſts that the Eſſence is not diſtinguiſhed, but the perſons; <hi>for the Word was God:</hi> That there is ſuch a diſtinction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord;</hi> there the perſon ſpeaking, and the perſon ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are diſtinguiſhed: the Lord ſaid to Sathan, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee;</hi> where in the firſt place is the Son, <hi>the Lord rebuke thee,</hi> he meanes the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.32. <hi>there is another that beareth witneſſe of me:</hi> and in <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.18. <hi>I beare witneſſe of my ſelfe: Iohn</hi> 14.10. <hi>I am with the Father:</hi> he doth not ſay, I am the Father, but <hi>I am with the Father:</hi> whereupon it muſt needes be, that there is diſtinction, betweene the Father, and Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt is diſtinguiſhed perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from them both, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. there is a voyce from heaven, and the Spirit deſcended like a Dove, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaking, and the Sonne is he of whom he ſpeaks, the holy Ghoſt he that deſcended, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16.27. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforter</hi> in my name: whence it followes, that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102519:149"/>therefore the Father who ſends, and the Sonne who prayes, and the holy Ghoſt who is ſent, are three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons really diſtinguiſhed. This may ſuffiſe to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that there are three diſtinct perſon.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But how are they diſtinguiſhed in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, becauſe they are one before and after another, by an unchangeable order; firſt, ſecond and third, they are not one before another in dignity, but in order, and that is unchangeable; for the firſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the ſecond, nor the third; the Father cannot be the ſecond perſon, nor the Sonne cannot be the firſt, nor the third, &amp;c. the reaſon of this is, becauſe the Father is of himſelfe, not of another, having the foundation of perſonall exiſtance or ſubſtance in himſelfe and of himſelfe; therefore it muſt needs be, that he muſt be the firſt; that is that which ſome thinke Chriſt intended, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.26. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath life in himſelfe;</hi> that is, firſt, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Sonne is of another, and therefore he cannot be the firſt perſon, becauſe he hath the foundation of a perſonall ſubſiſtance from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo he cannot be the third perſon, becauſe he hath it onely from the Father: this is that ſame in <hi>Iohn,</hi> As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelfe &amp;c. he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it from the Father. The holy Ghoſt is neither of the Father alone, nor of the Sonne alone, but he is of them both; therefore he is the third perſon recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the foundation of perſonall ſubſiſtance from the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102519:149"/>Father and the Sonne; then this immutable order doth diſtinguiſh them. It is true, that the Scripture places the Sonne before the Father, and the holy Ghoſt before the Sonne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the love of God the Father, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: Revel.</hi> 1.4, 5 <hi>Iohn</hi> wiſhes ſalvation to the Churches, firſt, from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſecondly, from the Spirit: this is not to change their order, but becauſe the matter they ſpeake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; and to ſhew that there is none greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then other.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How are they diſtinguiſhed by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They have every one incommunicable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, by which they are diſtinguiſhed; the Father begetting the Sonne, the Sonne being begotten, and the holy Ghoſt proceeding; theſe properties are ſuch as cannot be communicated to others without them, nor amongſt themſelves; ſuch as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any beginning of the world; this is as ſome Divines ſay, nothing but the proper manner of exiſting; for they ſay, the Father is the nature of the Divine Eſſence, ſubſiſting by the incommunicable property of begetting: The Sonne is the nature of the divine Eſſence, ſubſiſting by the incommunicable property of being begotten. The holy Ghoſt is the nature of the divine Eſſence, ſubſiſting by his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable property of proceeding. I ſay, by theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations they were diſtinguiſhed amongſt themſelves, before there was any creation. The Father is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, begetting the Sonne: The Sonne is begotten
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102519:150"/>by an unſearchable generation; the holy Ghoſt is of the Father and the Sonne, after a wonderfull manner, which is called proceſſion.</p>
               <p>That they are thus diſtinguiſhed, is gathered out of the Scriptures, thus; becauſe the Scriptures never tell us of any originall, or beginning that the Father had, therefore is unbegotten. Againe, the Scriptures tell us that there was one begotten, and that was the Sonne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee, Iohn</hi> 1.14. <hi>the onely begotten Sonne, Rom.</hi> 8.32. he is called his owne Sonne: then it is manifeſt, that there is a ſecond which is begotten. Laſtly, the Scriptures tell us of one that proceeded from them both; it is manifeſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.26. The comforter that I ſhall ſend, is the holy Ghoſt; and thereupon he is called the Spirit of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. and the Spirit of the Sonne, whom the Father will ſend in your hearts; why? becauſe he proceeds from them both: obſerve a little more, theſe are the particulars of the perſons, the Father begets, (I doe not ſay, the Eſſence begets) the Sonne is begotten, (I doe not ſay, the Eſſence is begotten,) this is underſtood of the perſon, not of the Eſſence; why? becauſe they muſt have the Eſſence of themſelves, or elſe they cannot be God. Theſe perſonall actions, which they exerciſe one to another, are called internall works; and hereupon that ground is, that the Schooles hold, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall works are divided, that they cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; the Father in begetting, the Sonne in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begotten, and the holy Ghoſt proceeding.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How are they diſtinguiſhed by their works?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:102519:150"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their workes are creation, redemption, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and the like, which in the ſubſtance are common to them all three, but in manner of working are proper to ſome one.</p>
               <p>To explane this, There is a rule, that the works of the Trinity without them, are undivided; theſe three perſons are together, and worke together: for there is but one worke, they worke all together. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes plainly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Let us make man:</hi> where we ſee, there is a common worke; the Father faith not to the Sonne, I will make man, or make you the man, &amp;c. but, <hi>let us make, &amp;c.</hi> This is that which Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.25. <hi>The Father workes hitherto, and I worke:</hi> and ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.15. All that the Father hath is mine; whatſoever it is that is the Fathers, is mine; the difference is in the order, and manner of working: this is manifeſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Thankes be unto God that hath given us victory, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> where God gives the victory, but by Chriſt. The Fathers uſe much one teſtimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Of him, and through him, and for him, are all things, to him be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes there of works, which we call works <hi>a dextra;</hi> he nameth three manners of working, and yet he ſaith, there is but one God, and therefore to him be glory. Now on the other ſide, as the Eſſence may not be divided, ſo the perſons are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; for he ſaith, <hi>of him, and through him and for him, are all things:</hi> the Father workes all things of himſelfe, by the Sonne; and the Sonne workes from the Father, by the holy Ghoſt: this is the manner of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102519:151"/>working. And before I come to the Reaſon, let me adde one thing more; a diſtinction which <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had: the workes of the Trinity are to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abſolutely as they are God, ſo they are common to them all; and relatively, that is to ſay, that every one workes according to his perſonall property, and ſo one creates, and another redeemes, and another ſanctifies. The reaſon is this, for the Father, he is of himſelfe, and therefore workes of himſelfe; the Son is not of himſelfe, as a perſon, but from the Father; and therefore he workes from the Father, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt from them both, and is not of himſelfe as a perſon, and therefore workes not of himſelfe, but from them both: thus the ground of their working, is the manner of their ſubſiſting; therefore we give the Father the beginning of the worke, and the Son the forwarding and framing, and the holy Ghoſt, the effecting, &amp;c. So that we ſee, by this that I have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; firſt, what is communicated to them all, wherein they differ, and how they differ <hi>(viz.)</hi> by order, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and manner of working.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This takes away an imputation, that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques have laid upon the Church, that it hath brought in vaine appellations, in expreſſing this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and they tell us that it is forbiden that a woman ſhould ſpeake in the Church; the meaning of which place they ſay is, that Phyloſophy which is but a handmaid, ſhould not ſpeake in the Church: Arius, Sabelliens, the great grand hereticks denied the diety of the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt; they had this cavell for themſeves, we ſpeake no other way,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102519:151"/>then God ſpeakes, we are caſt out of the Church, and excommunicated, becauſe we will not admit theſe prophane voices, of Trinity and Unity; but the Church is not worthy of blame, neither is there any excuſe for them; for the Church doth not take up theſe names out of any affectation of novelty, but as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes, meerly out of a neceſſity of ſpeech; namely, becauſe, that otherwiſe, they could not meet with, nor diſtinguiſh hereticks, that they might be better knowne when Hereticks began to oppoſe this doctrine; they would ſay there was one God, and when they ſaw there was three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt; they would ſay theſe three were one God, but how? as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. the Saints had all one heart, therefore the Church takes theſe termes, one in Eſſence, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Hereticks; ſo they will ſay, that there was a Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, but that the Father was ſometimes the Sonne, and ſometimes the holy Ghoſt: ſo that he was the Father in one reſpect, and the Sonne in another: hereupon the Church, upon warrant of the Scriptures, found out theſe words, that whereas Hereticks would ſpeake with the Church, and would not conceive and meane with the Church, they might be ſevered and known to be Hereticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, here is direction, for every man that will truely and ſavingly beleeve, in one, and three; in one Eſſence, and three diſtinct perſons; not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Eſſence, nor confounding the perſons: he that beleeves in a God, and not in three perſons, hath a fiction of his owne braine, which he beleeves in; he
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102519:152"/>that beleeves, that there are not three perſons diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and one Eſſence, cannot be ſaved; for a man cannot be ſaved, but by true faith: but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not in the trinity, as he hath revealed himſelfe, hath not true faith; every man therefore muſt labour after this manner to beleeve: whereupon brethren, we inferre the neceſſity of the knowledge of this myſtery; for a man cannot beleeve, unleſſe he know it, therefore every one ought to bend his eares, and his head to know it: if God had revealed himſelfe in generall, it had bin enough to know him ſo; but God hath revealed himſelfe in particular, how he is one, and how he is three: therefore the Church knowing that this is neceſſary, hath appointed us a time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the premiſes: dare any man ſay, that this knowledg of God is not neceſſary? if this knowledge of God had not bin neceſſary, he would never have taught it; therefore ignorance of this is ſinne, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when a man is negligent, upon this ſuppoſition, that it is enough to know that there is a God, and no more; therefore every man ought to know this: it is neceſſary that every man that would be ſaved muſt beleeve, and no beleeving without a diſtinct under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Trinity; he ſhall be in danger of hell fire that doth not labour to know and underſtand it, when he hath the meanes; and yet there are, that will not know this diſtinction, but are content to have an implicit faith; it is the Doctrine of the Church, that a man that beleeves not this diſtinction, cannot be ſaved, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.23. he that denies the Sonne, hath not the Father.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:102519:152"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This inſtructs every man to worſhip God aright: how is that? undoubtedly, as he hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe in unity and trinity, not denying the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nor confounding the perſons: he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God, and not three perſons, worſhips an idoll; and he that worſhips three perſons, and not one God, worſhips three idols: therefore to avoid all idolatry, a man muſt be able to diſtinguiſh them; how? as a childe onely by three names; no, it is not enough to know no hereſie, but men muſt know to worſhip him him aright; therefore every man muſt labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him aright, as he hath revealed himſelfe, and here is the image that every man isalowed unto him, unity and trinity, &amp;c. it is not enough for a man not to conceive erroneouſly, but he muſt conceive truely. The worſhip of God is neceſſary; for whom? for God: nothing leſſe; it is nothing to God, that thou worſhip him; it is neceſſary for man, and it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to worſhip aright, then neceſſary as he hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and this they cannot doe unleſſe they know him. Turks, they cannot be ſaved, becauſe God hath not revealed himſelfe, one in three perſons to them: the Iewes, they cannot be ſaved, becauſe God hath not revealed one in three perſons to them: though God did in the old Teſtament ſhadow this out, yet he did it ſo darkly, that they underſtood it not. Then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is in the Church may be ſaved? no: they that live in the Church, and doe not endevour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand as God hath delivered to the Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. Then every one that cals vpon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved? no: there
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102519:153"/>is nothing more uſed in the Scriptures, then to put downe invocation, for all the worſhip of God, and ſo it is taken there: Then every one that worſhips God aright, ſhall be ſaved; yea, but how can a man invocate God, if he know not the advocate and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator Ieſus Chriſt? ſo, how ſhall a man performe any worſhip to God, but a fiction of his owne braine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he know this myſtery? therefore, fearefull muſt needs be the condition of ſuch, as are ignorant of this ſacred myſtery: This ſhould be a provocation to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, to labour to know theſe myſteries; you muſt goe and meditate about theſe things, and beat your heads about them: ſo that walking in the worſhippe of God here, hee will honour you, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>IN the next place it followes, that we ſpeake of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the perſons in their order: and the firſt is the Father, this text that I have read, gives ground to ſpeake of him, concerning whom, the firſt Queſtion principally to be handled is this; namely:</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:102519:153"/>
               <p>Queſt, <hi>What is the Father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is the firſt perſon in order, not in time; begetting the Sonne, creating the world: the thing that is deſcribed, is the Father: This word (Father) is applied to God in Scriptures two waies. Firſt, Eſſentially. Secondly, Perſonally. Eſſentially, in the firſt place; that is, when divine things, are oppoſed to humane; eternall, to earthly; God to the creature: and Father in this ſenſe, is not applied to the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Trinity, but to the whole Eſſence: and this is that which Chriſt taught us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Our Father which art in heaven:</hi> Father, there belongs to all. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We have all one Father;</hi> and in this reſpect the Sonne is called Father; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Father of eternity: Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Here I am, and the children that thou haſt given me:</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, and thoſe that were begotten by his word: and in this reſpect, the holy Ghoſt may have the name of Father, given to him: becauſe it is he that begets us againe, in which reſpect it is, that God is called Father, by creation, and Adoption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Father is to be taken perſonally, and that is with reference to the Sonne, and not to the creature: and ſo in this deſcription, Father is to be applied to the fitſt perſon; as appears by that which I have read. The next thing, I ſay, he is a perſon; the Eſſence is common to them all: but the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is three fold: by his order, and by his properties, and by his workes. Firſt, order, I ſay, the Father is firſt in order, not in time; becauſe the Son is coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall with him, he not before him: <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102519:154"/>ginning, (when other things began) there was the word with God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. He poſſeſſed me, in the beginning of his waies: a place ſo manifeſt of the Sonne of God, as <hi>Arrius,</hi> the grand enemy could not deny it; where he ſaith, I was with him before the world was: and thus the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> 5.2. hath it, ſpeaking of Chriſt, His goings forth have been of old, from everlaſting: there is mention, of two goings forth: one in time, and that is, as he was man, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. Secondly, another from everlaſting; and this was his begetting, of God from everlaſting and ſo the Father was not before him, in time: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. He is called the eternall ſpirit: a place common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, of the divine nature of Chriſt: ſo that by all this it appeares, he was before him, in order; not in time. The next thing is his property; beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Sonne, included in the name Father; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is unbegotten, and begets the Sonne; the Son is begotten, becauſe he hath a beginning of his perſon, from the Father: as Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> obſerves; the Father hath his foundation within himſelfe; we may beleeve the reaſon, becauſe that never any Heretique denied it; now he begat his Son, I ſhewed you it before: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Thou art may Son this day &amp;c.</hi> and ſo heer, unto which of the Angels, did he ſay, thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee? and therefore he is called the onely begotten Son: <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14. <hi>We ſaw his glory, as the glory of the onely begotten Sonne of God:</hi> therefore he is called the firſt begotten: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. If any aske me,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How begat he him?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:102519:154"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, I know not; no tongue can expreſſe, no heart can imagine, God hath not revealed it: that he did beget his Son, that is revealed; but the manner how, he hath not revealed: yet this we are ſure of; in the negative, we may underſtand how he was not begotten; every thing that is applied to God, being purged, and freed from corruption, and made perfect, is applied to him; therefore in generall, with men, there is imperfection, that the Father ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſon in time, this is imperfect; that the Father ſhould beget, a ſon out of himſelf, is imperfect; this is imperfect, for a father to beget a ſon by motion, and corruption, this is imperfect: but it is perfection, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him without motion: this is imperfection, for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beget a ſon with part of his Eſſence, but this is perfection to beget him without difference in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: here the Father, and the Son, are both at one time; the Father begets him, in himſelf, not of himſelf: thus much for the ſecond diſtinction of the roperty.</p>
               <p>The third diſtinction from the worke, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working, creating the world; of this we need no further proofe: it is enough that we beleeve in God, the Father almighty, &amp;c. where Father is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by his power: that as his Sonne hath the worke of redemption; the holy Ghoſt of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo the Father of creation: then I ſay, it is manifeſt, that the Father created the world, begetting his Son in himſelfe, of the ſame ſubſtance with himſelfe, creating the world out of himſelfe, of an unlike ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to himſelfe, being every way divers &amp;c. This ſhall ſuffice for the opening of this diſtinction.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:102519:155"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is he firſt in order, and not in time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is the eternall Father; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt have an eternall ſonne, and ſpirit, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wiſdome, and power.</p>
               <p>Firſt he is an eternall Father; therefore he muſt have an eternall Sonne: for Father, and Sonne, are relatives, one gives the being, to the other: Husband, and wife, are relatives: Kings, and Subjects, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives: Kings give a being to the ſubjects; ſo in this, Father, and Sonne are relatives: no Father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sonne, and no Son without a Father; and no ſooner a father, then a ſonne: if a man be a father, he he muſt be elder then his ſonne; but God cannot be a Father elder then his Sonne: therefore as Father, and Son, they are of the ſame age; as it were the ſame day, the ſame houre, as I may ſo ſpeake, they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternall, and therefore both of the ſame time: Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, how ſhall not he be from the beginning, that had nothing before him, but himſelfe, from whom he had his beginning? In the next place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is an eternall God, and hath an eternall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: no God without his wiſdome; deny wiſdome, and deny the Sonne: ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>He is called the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Father.</hi> 23. verſe, he ſaith, I was before his workes, before all creatures whatſoever: he and his wiſdome, were never ſeparated; therefore it followes, that he muſt needs be an eternall Sonne: hereupon is it, that which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the wiſdome of God: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls the word of God, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the word: therefore he muſt be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perſon.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:102519:155"/>
               <p>Thirdly, the eternall God, muſt have eternall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, for God without power is nothing: ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the moſt high, ſhall overſhadow thee:</hi> where God is not without his power; then we conclude, that ſeeing he is an eternall Father, he muſt have an eternall Son, and ſpirit: and the eternall God, muſt have eternall wiſdome, &amp; power, therefore he is put firſt in order.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How is he diſtinguiſhed by begetting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By communicating his whole Eſſence from all eternity: the Sonne is begotten; how? by receiving his whole Eſſence from his Father: The Father begetting the Sonne, by communicating his Eſſence; but how gives he to him, his whole Eſſence? not by alienation, but by communication: we thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it; he gave him his whole Eſſence, becauſe the whole Eſſence of God, is ſo ſimple, that it cannot be divided; if it were divided, it were the overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Eſſence; therefore when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates, he communicates not a part, but the whole; and when he communicates, he doth it not by alienation, for then it ſhould ceaſe in him that gave it; but it doth not ceaſe ſo, but by communication it is ſo given; that abides his ſtill, though he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates it to the Sonne; one teſtimony for many, <hi>Collo.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In him dwelleth the Godhead bodily.</hi> For in this Generation, there is no diviſion, nor tranſmutation, and yet there is a true multiplication of perſons, but not of the Eſſence; that never divides.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>The third thing, how is he diſtinguiſhed by the work of creation?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:102519:156"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not by working, but by the manner of working; becauſe the Father creates by the Son, and by the holy Ghoſt: the work is common to all, for all create, but the maner is different: you heard the reaſon before; theſe cannot be divided; but the Father begins the worke, and executes it by them, and the reaſon is becauſe the Father, hath his beginning of his perſon himſelfe; and the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, receive it from the Father; therefore it is the Father creates by them; and is diſtinguiſhed from them, not in the matter wrought, but in the manner of working: and thus I have opened this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This teaches us, how we ought to beleeve concerning the Father: namely, that he is thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in order not in time: if any man ſhould have a thought, &amp; nouriſh it, that the Father ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son, or ſpirit, in time, he doth not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Trinity, as much as in him is, but the Deity: S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, if the Father had beginning before the Son, then he was God firſt, and Father af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that cannot be; God turne this thought from our hearts, ſaith he: tell me then, how doſt thou beleeve, that he is the immutable God? if he be ſo, (how can this ſtand?) there is a mutation, by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Father, there is a change: how is he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change? if a God firſt, then a Father: God turne ſuch conceits from us; it may well be with men, he is a man now, and father ſome yeares after, for he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change; but bring the nature of God to a change, and thou overthroweſt the nature of God; therefore we muſt beware of this: thus we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102519:156"/>that the eternall Father, is with the Sonne; and the eternall Son, with the Father: he that will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God aright, let him joine theſe two together, that the Diety hath joined together; beware you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate none of theſe. It is true, we are to hold it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a divine manner; not to judge of it, by a humane generation; as that the Father, muſt be elder then the Sonne, we are not to judge after this manner, for this is the ground of errors: againe, if the Father beget his Sonne, then he is divided; we hold no ſuch thing, he did not beget him in time, and if they will follow humane generations, then the Father muſt have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſexe, to beget him upon; and if you will have it, as in humane generations, then the mother muſt have a wombe to carry the Son, nine or ten monthes: if theſe be abſurdities; why would you tie us to this, contrary to the word? this we are to hold, and to looke to that which is revealed; and to goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: we conclude this uſe, with a ſpeech of Saint <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> it is impoſſible ſaith the father, for me to know, the ſecrets of this generation; he ſaith well, for we may not ſearch into theſe ſecret, and high myſteries; it is ſuch a thing, that when I thinke of it, my minde failes me, I know not how to utter it: <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding.</hi> How much more this, the Father begetting the Son? clap thine hand upon thy mouth, and admire at theſe things! thou knoweſt he did it, but thou muſt not ſearch how it was, he did it; let us reſt with that which God hath revealed that we may not fall into error.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:102519:157"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, this commends the great love of God to man; that when he had a Sonne, a naturall Sonne, begotten in, and of himſelfe, yet he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt other ſonnes, to be heires of the ſame glory with this Sonne; this is great love. It is the love in men, that if a man be childeleſſe, and have not a ſon, he adopts a ſtranger; this is accounted great love, that he will adopt anothers ſonne, and make him his own; but when a man hath a ſonne, then to adopt, and then to take an others, it will be accounted exceeding love: many men, when they have a naturall ſonne, deſire to have no more; ſome men have many ſonnes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to make the eldeſt great, the eldeſt ſhall have all, and the yonger nothing (God made another law, but we forget nature and law too, this by the way:) but if parents love be ſuch, Gods is much more; that when he had a naturall Sonne, he adopted many to be heires with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſet forth this love to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that when he had twelve ſonnes, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he loved <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> he would adopt them, that they ſhould be the heires of the land of promiſe; and yet there was ſome reaſon; but ſee, here is greater love in God, when he had but one Sonne, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to adopt enemies to make them ſonnes, that they might be heires together with him, of the ſame hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object,</hi> Some may ſay, you talke ſo much of Gods love to others, that you leſſon his love to Chriſt; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the world will ſay, he loves him not, that he makes other heires with him.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:102519:157"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, the great Emperours of the world cannot make a diviſion of their Empires, but they muſt leſſen them; but ſuch is the riches of God, that this Sonne ſhall not have the leſſe for diviſions: for as Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſpeakes of the Sunne; the Sun (ſaith he) God hath ſo created, that it may enlighten many men, and ſo every man hath abundance of the light of it, and yet the Sunne hath nothing the leſſe it ſelfe: ſo God can communicate his celeſtiall glory, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly kingdome to all his ſonnes; he can make them all kings, and ſonnes, and heires, and fellow heires with Chriſt; ſo that man ſhall have enough, and he not the leſſe, for there is no dividing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Againe, this teaches us, Hath he begotten the Sonne? hath he an onely begotten Sonne? we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) the firſt begotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was none before him; and the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, becauſe there was none after him; he was his owne and onely Sonne, What Uſe make you of this? This: Conſider of the Juſtice of God, and the great ſtrictneſſe of juſtice, that he had but one Sonne, and he voluntarily tooke our nature upon him, and alſo tooke our ſinnes, to ſtand in our roomes, to anſwer for our ſinnes; yea, that this naturall Sonne, this onely Sonne intreated his Father, that <hi>if it were poſsible this cup might paſſe from him:</hi> yet notwithſtanding, he would have him drinke of it for the ſatisfying for our ſinnes: this would be counted great ſeverity with an earthly King, if his ſonne ſhould tranſgreſſe, to cut him off; but when he had not committed any thing, to cut him off for others offences, it would be counted
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102519:158"/>great injuſtice. If ſo be it was an evidence of ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of juſtice, which ſtories ſpeake of heathen men, that an Emperour, when his ſonne had offended the Law, and both his eyes were to be put out, put out one of his owne eyes, and one of his ſonnes, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the law: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.29. Or that of <hi>Saul,</hi> he that hath done this, ſhall dye, though it be <hi>Ionathan</hi> my ſonne: how then doth this argue a great ſtrictneſſe, and love of juſtice, ſeeing there is one, that for our ſinnes, though he was Gods naturall Sonne, was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to death of his Father? What of this? Marke here the love, and juſtice of God, that he hath ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men; who, that he might ſpare them, would have his juſtice ſatisfied by his owne Sonne; and though he intreated him, yet he would not heare him: know hence, and ſee the ſeverity of God to ſinners, and the mercy of God to us: therefore let us make more conſcience of ſinne; let us ſee the fearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe that reape no benefit of Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>This ſerves to ſtrike terrour and fear into the hearts of Gods owne children; for if they ſinne, they are ſubject to the hand of God, till they repent; for if we be wanton and careleſſe, he will not ſpare his owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſonnes, that ſpared not his naturall Son; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to know him, and ſerve him, and we ſhall have eternall life hereafter.</p>

               <p>THE firſt perſon is the Father, of whom we have ſpoken: the ſecond perſon is the Sonne, of whom we are now to ſpeake: the ground of both, this text of Scripture will manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Sonne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He is the ſecond perſon in the Deitie, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father, redeeming the World. To open this deſcription: the Scriptures ſpeake of the ſonnes of God, foure wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, by Creation; and ſo are principally men and Angels: whereupon, in the firſt of <hi>Iob,</hi> the Angels are ſaid to be the ſonnes of God: and ſo <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10. men are ſaid to be the ſonnes of God; we have all one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 2.3. <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be the ſon of God, and ſucceſſively all mankinde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by Regeneration; and ſo all the elect being begotten anew, are ſonnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. they that have the ſpirit of God, are his ſonnes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. by faith we are all the ſonnes of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſonnes, &amp;c. many ſuch teſtimonies there are, but they are needleſſe to our purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:102519:159"/>
               <p>Thirdly, by Generation, and ſo the ſecond perſon in the deitie, is begotten of his Father.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by Union, and ſo onely the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, by that union it hath with, and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the ſecond perſon, is the Sonne of God, though naturally the ſonne of <hi>Mary.</hi> As a woman is ſaid to be ſuch a mans childe, when ſhe hath married his ſonne; and as the ſoule is not naturally begotten, but joyned to the body, yet we ſay the ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are but one; ſo the humane nature of Chriſt is the Sonne of God, by way of perſonall union: now that Sonne which we ſpeake of, is not by creating, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating, nor uniting, but by generation, of whom we ſay he is a perſon, and the ſecond perſon in order, not in time, as we have ſhewed of the Father; this we adde as a difference, that he is a ſecond perſon of the deity: my reaſon is, becauſe I would by this prove that he is God; for the Father, none doe make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but for the Sonne they doe, therefore we will manifeſtly prove, that he is the ſecond perſon in the deity, coſubſtantiall with the Father; we manifeſt this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that beare witneſſe,</hi> of what? namely, <hi>that Chriſt was the Sonne of God, and the Sonne of Mary:</hi> it ſhall ſuffiſe us therefore; firſt, his Father witneſſeth at his Baptiſme, and transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; at his Baptiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> at his transfiguration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. So then it is manifeſt by the teſtimony of the Father, that he is the Sonne of God by generation. Secondly, the Word witneſſeth it, that he is the Sonne himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102519:159"/>begotten Sonne:</hi> not to ſtand upon this <hi>(his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne,)</hi> then he muſt be a Sonne by generation: but it is added, <hi>whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> never was there any other Sonne of God, that could deliver any, no, not from temporall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much leſſe from eternall, by beleeving onely in him: but this Sonne of God doth ſo; for what ſaith the Prophet, though theſe three, <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> were there, they ſhould ſave neither ſonne nor daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but their owne ſoules; therefore it followes, that this Sonne muſt needes be God: adde to this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.17. <hi>The Father workes hitherto, and I worke:</hi> it is as much to ſay, I am God: how gather you that? it was a phraſe ſo apparant among the Iewes, that he would make himſelf God (by calling himſelfe the Son of God,) that they challenged him with blaſphemy, becauſe he ſaid he was the Sonne of God <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and the Father am one:</hi> there is the unitie of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and diſtinction of perſons: one, how? one in will, and power, and Eſſence; and therefore it was, that they went about to kill him; he asked them, why will you kill me? they anſwered him, becauſe thou being a man, makeſt thy ſelfe God: againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.4. concerning the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> this was done to the glorifying of God, and that the Sonne might be glorified; marke what he ſaith, that the ſickneſſe of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and his death, was for the glory of God: how? for the glorifying of God? for the glorifying of the Sonne of God; intimating unto us, that the Sonne of God, and God are all one; ſo that all theſe ſerve for the teſtimony of the Sonne. Thirdly, the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102519:160"/>teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt, who gave no ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies as theſe, but gave teſtimony by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, for he ſpake by them, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9.6. <hi>he ſhall be called the mighty God;</hi> wherein he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was God: it is not ſaid, he ſhall be made the mighty God: not by office, (ſo men are:) And though the name god, is given to men, yet the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is given to none but God; and in the ſame place he is called the Father of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, therefore he muſt needs be God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. God appeares to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that God was Chriſt; that appeares in the ſecond verſe, becauſe he commands him to doe that which was contrary to the Law, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>take thy Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> who could command this but God, and not ſinne? this was not the Father, becauſe that in the 11. verſe, he is called <hi>the Angell of the Lord,</hi> but never was the Father called the angell of any; therefore it muſt needs be the Sonne: but was it not a created Angel? no: that appeares, becauſe in the 22. verſe, he ſaith, <hi>becauſe thou haſt not ſpared thy ſonne for my ſake, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore it muſt be the Sonne of God, and alſo by reaſon of that ſame which is added, it cannot be any other but the Sonne, becauſe he bids him ſtay his hand: and finally, in the 16. verſe, he ſweares by himſelfe, that he ſhall be rewarded, which no created angel could doe, and therefore it muſt needs be the Sonne, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>he thought it no robbery to be equall with God;</hi> that is, in ſuch eſtate, that God was: ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>the godhead dwelt bodily in him;</hi> that is, the whole deitie; and not as ſome would diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his divinity, for then it might have bin ſome
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:102519:160"/>qualities, but he ſaith the deitie.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, his propertie; he is the begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne, it muſt needs be the Sonnes property, and this is conſidered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> (This place applyed by the Apoſtle to the reſurrection of Chriſt is not weakned, becauſe by the reſurrection his eternall generation was declared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>declared to be the Sonne of God, by the reſurrection from the dead:</hi>) ſo you heard <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14.33.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. he is called the <hi>begotten Sonne of his Father.</hi> The Sonne is unbegotten in reſpect of his Eſſence, yet begotten in reſpect of his perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had his perſonall exiſtence from his Father; begotten (here is to be underſtood with purging from all impurity) before all time, not in time; not out of the Father, but in the Eſſence of the Father: he is not begotten by any motion and corruption; he hath not part of the Eſſence, but the whole Eſſence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all imperfection being taken away, he may be ſaid to be begotten.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the worke of Redemption; redeeming the elect from their bondage wherein they were, from ſinne and ſathan, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.9. we are ſaid to be juſtified by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? it is Chriſt that juſtifies, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>We have redemption through his blood,</hi> from ſathan, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21, 22. the ſtrong man is caſt out, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. he came to diſſolve the works of the divell, and from death, he was made a curſe for us; and therefore the Apoſtle ſo triumphs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 6. <hi>Oh death! where is thy ſting? thankes be unto God, who</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:102519:161"/>hath given us the victory through Chriſt Jeſus: and ſo this deſcription is made plaine to you.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doe you ſay, that he is the ſecond perſon in the Deity, and ſo God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he is equall to God. Secondly, becauſe the name Jehovah, is given unto him. Thirdly, becauſe Eſſentiall Attributes, are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Fourthly, proper workes, and ſo divine workes are given to him: to explane theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ſay, he is equall to God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.15. <hi>All that the Father hath is mine.</hi> It is manifeſt, that there is equality; an adopted ſonne cannot ſay, that all, that my father hath is mine, he cannot cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it; but Chriſt chalengeth this to himſelfe: therefore, neceſſarily it muſt be, that he is God: <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He that was in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God:</hi> by forme is meant Eſſentiall forme, whereby he was equall to God, not an accidentually forme, as men are ſaid to be partakers of the divine nature; but if he have a forme that was equall to God, it muſt be an Eſſentiall forme; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the Apoſtle ſaith, that he tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant: what was that? not the ſhape of man, but the Eſſentiall forme of a ſervant: ſo alſo he was in the Eſſentiall forme of God, and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to God. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The Godhead dwelt in him bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</hi> If the ſon of man, be man, becauſe he hath all the parts of man, becauſe he hath the ſame kind by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Chriſt then having the ſame ſpirituall nature, muſt neceſſarily, be equall with God. The ſecond thing, the name Jehovah, is given unto him: a title
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102519:161"/>as we heard before, which is given to none but the true God: ſo the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.18. <hi>Thou whoſe name alone is Iehovah.</hi> That this is given to Chriſt appears, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.5.6. ſpeaking of raiſing up a branch of <hi>David,</hi> he ſaith in the 6. verſe, <hi>They ſhall call him Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah our righteouſneſſe:</hi> and in 33. Chap. 15.16. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>He ſhall be called the Lord our righteouſneſſe.</hi> A multitude of other places might be noted: in the old Teſtament, he is called Jehovah; in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is ſaid, that they tempted Chriſt, in the wilderneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.6. there it is ſaid, that they tempted the Lord; whence it followes, that the name Jehovah, was given to Chriſt. Thirdly, Eſſentiall Attributes are given to him, as in that place before, all that the Father hath is mine, eternity, omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1.2. <hi>In the beginning was the word &amp;c.</hi> omnipreſency, being in every place; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midſt of them. Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I will be with you till the end of the world. Iohn</hi> 3.13. <hi>Who is he that aſcended, but he that deſcended?</hi> Intimating, that while he was upon the earth, he was in heaven, &amp;c. omniſciency, knowing all things: <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.15. <hi>He knows the thoughts of mens hearts Iohn</hi> 21.17. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee:</hi> for thou knoweſt all things; omnipotency, ſo it appears, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5 19. <hi>All that the Father doth, the ſame doth the Sonne; and all that the Sonne doth, the ſame doth the Father. Philip.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Being ſtrengthened by his mighty power, by which he is able to do all things:</hi> ſo that theſe things, being given to him, he muſt be God. Laſtly, proper
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102519:162"/>workes of God, are given to him, as creation, that is given to him; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. <hi>He created all things that were made. Heb.</hi> 1.10. The holy Ghoſt ſaid, that he created, and ſo the working of miracles, as to raiſe up the dead, theſe were the workes of God. Laſtly, divine worſhip is given to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.23. <hi>That all men might honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father;</hi> That which is given to the Father, may be given to the Sonne; which could not be except he were God: &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. <hi>You beleeve in the Father, beleeve alſo in me. Acts</hi> 7.50. <hi>Lord Ieſus receive my ſoule.</hi> So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, be with you. Philip,</hi> 2. <hi>At the name of Ieſus every knee ſhall bow:</hi> that is, all ſhould worſhip him; therefore it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followes, that he is God: &amp;c. and ſo you have this explaned.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is he ſaid, to be begotten of the Father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he received the whole Eſſence by communication, not by alienation; in which there is no motion: Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, the Sonne is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without paſſion, without action; ſo that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates the whole Eſſence to him. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In him dwells all the Godhead bodily:</hi> Eſſentially, as a candle receives light without corruption; as the ſunne that communicates his beames, and hath no dimunition.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But why ſay you, that he redeemes the elect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he only tooke the nature of man; gave himſelfe as a price to ſet them free, from death, and hell, and reconciled them to God: from the worke of redemption, we exclude not the Father; yet notwithſtanding there is a difference, the Father
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102519:162"/>ſends his Sonne, the Sonne gave himſelfe, the holy Ghoſt applies it, but the manner of redemption is far different; what is that? he tooke the nature of man, and ſo the word was made fleſh; and ſatisfied the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; and thus he onely paid the price: <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>He gave himſelfe a ranſome. Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>He purchaſed them with his bloud. Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelfe for them, that they might be a peculiar people unto himſelfe:</hi> and therefore he muſt be a perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed: and thus we have runne thorough this deſcription.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The uſe is, Firſt, for the matter of confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this muſt informe us, how we ought to beleeve to ſalvation, concerning the Sonne; that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void their hereſies, which ſay, that he is not God by nature, but by office: neither may we thinke, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid he is begotten, there was a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was not, for he was from eternity: Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaking to them of his time, take heed of this, ſaith he, when we ſay that he was begotten: we doe not ſay, that he was after the Father; but ſhew whence he had his perſon, nor make him inferior in time; but ſhew that he had his perſon from the Father: take heed therefore of this; though we cannot ſee this, yet we are to beleeve it by faith: This generation of Chriſt, is to be adored by ſilence, and faith; and not to be enquired into; he was begotten, when there was neither time, nor ſpectator; neither was there any interpreter to tell us: Why then ſhould the minde of man imagine, and ſpeake of this any more? the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his generation as man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:102519:163"/>ſaith, <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſſe:</hi> God manifeſted in the fleſh, this was a myſtery; if this was ſo great a myſtery, what is the divine generation? ſome ſhadow it after this manner: it is no unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing, that the begetter, and the begotten, ſhould be both at one, and the ſame time: the minde begets a reaſon, the minde is the begetter, and the reaſon begotten, are both at one and the ſame time: Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, it is no abſurd thing, to ſay that the begetter, and the begotten, may be together: as there are in a candle lighted, two things; the light, and the fire; if the queſtion be, what is the cauſe of the light? the anſwer muſt be fire: but if we ſhould aske, whether the light, or heat, were firſt? we could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they are both together: if it may be thus in the creature, how much more in the creator?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This in the next place, commends unto us, the love of Chriſt; though he was God, and equall to God the Father; though he was the eternall, and infinite God; yet he became our redeemer: the worke doth not ſo much commend his love, as the manner of the working; if compariſons may be here modeſtly admitted, it ſeemes, there is a greater love, that Chriſt doth manifeſt, then the Father, &amp;c. the Father ſheweth his love in appointing, and ſending, and giving; but the Sonne gives himſelfe for us; the Fathers love is apparent, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.4.5. <hi>I will give men for thee &amp;c.</hi> where God ſhewes his love, to the intent (ſaith the Lord) that I might free thee; I put thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, yet what are theſe? theſe are nothing in compariſon of his love, in redeeming his elect; he
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:102519:163"/>put his owne Sonne, into his enemies hands: ſo we may ſee, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>So God loved the world. Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>God ſets forth his love, that when we were enemies, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, ſee the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the love of Chriſt in this, he being God, humbleth himſelfe to the loweſt degree, that he might redeem his: as firſt, he tooke fleſh. Secondly, he dies. &amp;c. Now all this, is grounded upon this, that he being God, humbleth himſelfe, (laying aſide all his glory) to the death of the croſſe: What ſhall I ſay, what could he have done more? this amplifies the love of Chriſt, to give himſelfe freely; there was no neceſſity of nature, or ſinne compelled him; but meerly voluntarily, that he might redeem us: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, doe you thinke, that the ſpears could have pearced him, unleſſe he himſelfe, had ſuffered it? as he ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>I could intreat my Father, and he could give me more then twelve legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> but yet he being the mighty Sonne of God, laies all aſide, and puts on all baſeneſſe: what of all this? this ſhould provoke us to thankfullneſſe, (as <hi>David</hi> in 116. <hi>Pſal.</hi>) to ſay, <hi>What ſhall I render to Chriſt for all his benefits?</hi> Iſrael, when they were delivered out of Egypt, and paſſed the red ſeas, ſung a ſong, &amp;c. if ſuch a ſmall thing required this; what doth this, that we are delivered from ſinne, and Sathan, require? It is not enough that we ſing ſongs, and ſpeake good words, but let Chriſt have his end, for which he hath redeemed us: what is his end? <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>That we ſhould ſerve him in holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, all the daies of our lives:</hi> let us give our ſelves to his ſervice,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102519:164"/>and feare: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.9. There the people reaſon after this manner, <hi>David</hi> hath delivered us out of the hand of our enemies; and ſhall we be ſlack? thus we ſhould ſpeake to our hearts; hath Chriſt delivered us from death, and the thraldome of Sathan; and ſhall we be ſlack in giving honour to Chriſt? <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13.14. the people reaſon thus, that being delivered (ſay they) ſhall we turn back again, &amp;c. how then ſhould every one ſpeake to his owne heart, thou haſt taſted of this, and ſhall I turne backe againe, and tranſgreſſe againſt Chriſt? therefore learne to remember what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>He hath redeemed us a people to himſelfe, to be zealous of good workes;</hi> and thou that condemneſt well ordered zeale, thou haſt no dram of religion in thee; for no true zeale, no religion: thou crieſt out of zeale, thou art a ſlave to Sathan ſtill: therefore let every man bring forth righteouſneſſe, and deny ungodlineſſe, and live ſoberly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen world, walking, and glorifying God here, that we may be glorified of him hereafter.</p>

               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is the third perſon of the Diety pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father, and the Sonne, ſanctifying the elect.</p>
               <p>The thing that is deſcribed, is the ſpirit, which in the Scriptures ſignifies many things; it may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to theſe heads; I will but name them: Firſt, it hath relation to the creature. Secondly, to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; as it hath relation to the creature, the word ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies many things, I will but name them: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſignifies power, ſometimes the ſoule of man, ſometimes the life of beaſts, ſometimes Angels, ſometimes naturall motions in the heart of man; and divers others, which I paſſe over.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the creator, it hath a double ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and it is taken, Eſſentially, and perſonally: Eſſentially, and ſo all the three perſons of the Trinity, are ſaid to be a ſpirit; according to this, we have it,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:102519:165"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a ſpirit;</hi> where the whole Diety is put under the name of ſpirit. Secondly, it is taken perſonally in the Diety, concerning whom: ſpirit may ſignifie two things, either the perſon, or the gifts; the perſon it ſelfe, it is manifeſt in this place; the ſpirit that proceeds from the Father; the gifts and graces of the ſpirit: 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.19. <hi>Let thy ſpirit be double upon me:</hi> So <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit;</hi> underſtanding it, of the grace of the ſpirit: againe, I ſay the third perſon, I need not ſtand upon that, to ſhew that it is a perſon, common to him with the other; all perſons are diſtinct one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, really, and truly; he is a perſon diſtinct three waies: in order, in property, and working; in order he is the third perſon; in property, he proceeds from the Father, and the Son, in working, ſanctifying, the elect: the Father is the firſt, not in time, not in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in order: ſo the Son the ſecond; and ſo the holy Ghoſt the third: we adde, the third perſon in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that we may have occaſion to manifeſt, that he is God as well as the other; that he is God, there may be many teſtimonies, <hi>Samuel</hi> 27.23. <hi>David</hi> the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael, the Lord God ſpake by me, the Lord ſaid; that, that is in the former the Lord, and God; in the next is ſaid to be the ſpirit: <hi>Acts</hi> 5.34. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ananias, why have you lied to the holy Ghoſt?</hi> and in the fourth verſe, <hi>You have not lied to men, but unto God:</hi> that in 1 <hi>Gor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>You brethren are the temples of God, and the holy Ghoſt dwelleth in you:</hi> temples of God, and temples of the holy Ghoſt, both one.</p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:102519:165"/>
               <p>The next thing, I ſay, is the third perſon, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Father and the Sonne: his property is proceeding: he is, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Creed hath it, not made, not begotten, but proceeding. That he doth proceed from the Father and the Sonne, appeares, firſt, by theſe places, that he is affirmed to be the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Father and the Sonne: not becauſe he was ſent, but becauſe he proceeds both from the Father and the Sonne; and that is this which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, when he gave the Spirit, he breathed upon the Apoſtles, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. to ſignifie, that when he gave the ſpirit, it was proceeding: and this is the ſame which the Pſalmiſt called the breath of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>by the word of God were the heavens made, and the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he is ſaid to be the breath of the Sonne: alſo in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>he ſhall conſume Antichriſt with the breath of his mouth:</hi> further, that he did proceed from the Father, is manifeſt by the place which we have read, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.26. and that he proceeds from the Son, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15 16. <hi>all that the Father hath is mine:</hi> ſo he ſaith he ſhall receive of mine; therefore the proceſſion is from them both: ſo that when our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, that it proceeds from the Father, he doth not exclude himſelfe, but after a ſpeciall manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, he ſets his name, after the name of his Father: Why? becauſe he hath his perſon from the Father, and the holy Ghoſt received it from them both; therefore we may give it to the Father, as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and this ſhall ſuffiſe to manifeſt this; therefore we will conclude as Saint <hi>Nazianzen</hi> doth, How is it
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102519:166"/>that the Sonne is of the Father, and the holy Ghoſt is of them both, comming from them both different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? the Sonne from the Father, as the light from the light; hee ſhines by the manner of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the holy Ghoſt, he is from the lights, not by manner of generation, but by manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
               <p>The third diſtinction, by which he is different from the other, is the worke of Sanctification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. therefore the name of life is given to him; it is he that mortifies the old man, and quickens the new man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7 <hi>The law of the Spirit of life, hath freed us from the law of ſinne, and of death:</hi> therefore he is after compared to water, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be borne of water and the holy Ghoſt:</hi> now the nature of water is to cleanſe, and to make fruitfull, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive things that are ready to dye: ſo the Spirit is he that cleanſeth us from our filthineſſe: ſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.21. <hi>I will power cleane water upon you, and you ſhall be cleanſed from all your filthines.</hi> What is that? in the 27. verſe, <hi>I will powre my Spirit upon you:</hi> ſo that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you ſee, is compared to water. In this reſpect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is compared to fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>He ſhall baptiſe you with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire:</hi> that doth quicken up the heart, and cheare it, and ſanctifie it: therefore hence it is in many places, that holineſſe is called the fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>the fruits of the ſpirit are joy, and peace, gentleneſſe, meekneſſe, long-ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> all theſe are fruits of the ſpirit; therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that the holy Ghoſt is he that hath this worke of ſanctifying the elect.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:102519:166"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why ſay we, that he is the third perſon in the deitie, and ſo God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he hath the name of Jehovah. Secondly, Eſſentiall Attributes. Thirdly, workes proper to God. Fourthly, divine worſhip; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is God. Firſt, the name Jehovah is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: that appeares by theſe texts of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.4. and ſo in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is given him the name of Jehovah. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. <hi>You ſtiffe necked that reſiſt the ſpirit of God, as did your fathers, ſo doe you, they reſiſted him in the Prophets, and you now do follow them, reſiſting him in the Apoſtles:</hi> one place more, <hi>Iſai</hi> 6.9. that which is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſaith go and make the heart of this people fat:</hi> that ſame 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſpake by Eſai as the Prophet;</hi> and therefore the name Jehovah being a peculiar name, given to none but to him, that is naturally God; the ſpirit having this name, muſt needs be God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are given unto him, Eſſentiall At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes: now Eſſentiall Attributes, are foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally; eternity, ubiquity, omniſcience, omnipotency, all theſe are given to the ſpirit: firſt, he is eternall; for before the beginning, he moved upon the waters, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. He is called the eternall ſpirit. Secondly, omnipreſence. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>Whither ſhall I goe from thy ſpirit?</hi> the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to dwell in the Saints; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.27. arguing that it is proper to him to be every where. Thirdly, he is omniſcient, and knowes all things. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.26. <hi>He ſhall teach you all things. Iohn</hi> 16.13. <hi>He ſhall lead you</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:102519:167"/>into all truth. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.11. <hi>He ſearches the hidden things of God, and no man knowes the hidden things of God, but the ſpirit.</hi> Fourthly, omnipotent; becauſe it is he that caſts out divells: <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God caſts &amp;c.</hi> this cannot be done by any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power, but he muſt be God that doth it: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>It is God that worketh all in all:</hi> And in the 11. verſe, <hi>The ſpirit worketh all theſe things;</hi> and therefore he muſt be omnipotent: and ſo by theſe foure Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, we ſee he is God.</p>
               <p>Againe, he muſt needs be God, for the proper works of God are given to him: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The ſpirit moved upon the waters,</hi> that is preſerving them; <hi>Iob</hi> 26.13. <hi>The ſpirit of God hath garniſhed the heavens;</hi> So in the 33. <hi>Iob</hi> 4 <hi>The ſpirit of the Almighty hath made me: Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe divine honour and worſhip, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without ſacriledge given to any perſon that is not God, but is given to him: <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt;</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle praies, the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God the father, and the Communion of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hath ſufficient to this purpoſe; he, ſaith he, whom the Church doth profeſſe to believe in, is God; now the Church doth profeſſe to believe in the holy Ghoſt, ſo that by theſe it neceſſarily followes that hee is God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How comes he to proceed from the father and the Sonne?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:102519:167"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he received from the father and the ſonne the whole Eſſence, communicated to him by way of proceſſion: that we manifeſt thus; the Sonnes begetting of the Father you heard, to be by receiving the whole Eſſence from him, by way of begetting: ſo the holy Ghoſt is ſayd to proceed from the Father, and the Sonne, becauſe he received the whole Eſſence from them by way of proceeding; the thing is manifeſt, that he proceeded from the Father, and the Sonne; and therefore is not ſaid to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but to proceed: and as the Scripture hath been ſtrict, and carefull, to reſerve theſe relations uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, ſo the Church hath diligently imitated them, and alwaies ſaies, that the Sonne is begotten, and the holy Ghoſt proceeds: and therefore as it is ſaid of the Sonne, that he is the onely begotten Son, of the Father: ſo it is ſaid in the ſame place of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he proceeds from the Father, and the Sonne; but how may we underſtand this, he received the whole Eſſence? how? he received it without diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he received it without multiplication; becauſe that which is infinite, cannot be multiplied; yet he received it without alienation, becauſe he received ſo the whole Eſſence, as it abides ſtill in the Father, and the Sonne.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How is he ſaid to ſanctifie the elect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he dwells in the elect, creating faith in them, incorporating them into Chriſt, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt his death, and reſurrection to them. To explane this: Firſt, he dwells in them: firſt, he is ſaid to ſanctifie the elect, in that he dwells in them: in this
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102519:168"/>we doe not exclude the Father, and the Sonne, any more then we did in the former; they are all workes <hi>ad extra,</hi> and therefore undivided; yet underſtand the manner of working: the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to dwell in the elect, &amp; it is he, that creates faith in their hearts &amp;c. they all ſanctifie; the Father, and the Son, mediatly by the ſpirit, the ſpirit immediatly by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and why? firſt, he dwells in them, namely, not as by his gifts, but a perſon, therefore we may ſay this is his worke: the Father not by any phraſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſaid to dwell in them, though they are ſaid to be the temples of God; he dwells in them not by his gifts onely, but by his perſon; becauſe he is called the ſpirit of his Sonne, when he dwells in them: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, God hath ſent the ſpirit of his Son: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If the ſpirit that raiſed Chriſt from the dead dwells in you:</hi> therefore they goe together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>God hath ſhed his love in our hearts:</hi> there is love which was the gift, and the ſpirit which was the perſon: againe, he created faith, that (the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.) <hi>By the ſame ſpirit he gave to one the gift of miracles, and to another the gift of faith: &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſpirit of faith:</hi> faith is that, that doth ſanctifie as an inſtrument: <hi>Acts</hi> 15. After that he had purified their hearts by faith.</p>
               <p>Next, that he doth incorporate men into Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>He that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> intimating, he that hath the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is his: <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know that God dwells in us by his ſpirit:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>We are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed into one body by the ſpirit,</hi> then we are all united
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102519:168"/>into one body, by one ſpirit: for as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 10. <hi>If the ſpirit be in you, the body is dead by reaſon of ſin, but the ſpirit is alive for righteouſneſſe ſake:</hi> and by this he doth apply unto us the death of Chriſt, to the death of ſinne, and the reſurrection of Chriſt, to the life of grace: <hi>Rom</hi> 6.3.4.5. <hi>As many as are baptiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, are baptiſed into the death of Chriſt:</hi> by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, we are alſo ingrafted into the ſimilitude of his reſurrection, therefore the ſpirit ſanctifies; &amp; when he dwells in every one of the elect, &amp;c. it is neceſſarily, and fitly ſaid, that it is he that ſanctifies the elect: and thus I have explaned this point, ſo much as I thought fit to communicate unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This teaches us, that we ought to labour for the knowledge of this, that we may keep our ſelves from error: it was a commendable diligence of the ancient Fathers that taught, when the ſpirit, was taken for the perſon, and when for the gifts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereſies have ſprung from hence, becauſe they underſtood the words amiſſe; therefore, that we may hold the truth, we are to labour to know it; and in this caſe, although we finde not a proper name given to the third perſon, yet we muſt acknowledge him diſtinctly; becauſe we know there is a Father, a Son, and a Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You tell us he is a Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer, ſo is the Father, and ſo is the Sonne, but ſo the name of Father is common to all; and the Sonne is ſaid to be the Father, and the holy Ghoſt alſo: therefore there is no reaſon why we ſhould conceive them to be three names given to the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102519:169"/>ſame God, in divers reſpects; but rather conceive, that there was but a common name given to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the common ſubſtantiall joy, and love, between the Father, and Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This ſerves to confirme us in the faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all hereticks, that deny the holy Ghoſt; not to ſtand upon their arguments: the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſtand up as it were to oppoſe the Diety of the holy Ghoſt, and ſay he is not God; and they thinke they have a colour for it, from the counſell of Nice; in which we ſay, we beleeve in the Father, God, and Lord, and in the Sonne, God, and Lord; but when they come to the holy Ghoſt, we beleeve in the holy Ghoſt; and therefore theſe hereticks ſay, that he was not God: Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> anſwering to this objection, from the Nicen counſell, ſaies; they had no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane this concerning the ſpirit, (as they had done the Father, and Sonne,) for no man then, made any queſtion of the divinity of the holy Ghoſt; nay ſaies <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> this is a ſufficient confeſſion of his Deity; for they ſay a particular thing, aſſenting by it, that he is God, becauſe they beleeve in him; and whereas they obſerve, that the ſpirit is taken for the gifts of the ſpirit, true it is; it is ſo, but it is put for the perſon alſo; and therefore though it be taken ſometime for the gifts, yet it doth not overthrow that he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: as the <hi>Arians</hi> that could not deny of Chriſt, that he was a perſon, ſaid notwithſtanding, he was but a made God: ſo theſe ſay of the ſpirit, that he is not a God by nature; but it is manifeſt, that he muſt needs be a God by nature, when he hath the name Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102519:169"/>and the proper workes of God attributed to him; yea but ſay they, if he were a God by office, yet he had a created nature, and ſo not God from eternity: the Fathers called theſe by that name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies fighters againſt the ſpirit of God; for they ſay, there was no ſpirit, till after Chriſts glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; grounded upon <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.39. The ſpirit was not given, becauſe that Chriſt was not yet glorified: and hereupon they added, that blaſphemy, the Church in the beginning was content to beleeve in one God; afterwards the counſell of Nice, muſt have two perſons, and after this the counſell of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople muſt have three; but to anſwer their cavill, that he was before all theſe, appears, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.32. <hi>I ſaw the holy Ghoſt ſaith Iohn Baptiſt (at Chriſts baptiſme) Iohn</hi> 1.33. <hi>Thou ſeeſt the holy Ghoſt to diſcend, after he was riſen: Iohn</hi> 20.21. <hi>He breathed upon the Apoſtles, and ſaies, receive the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they inſtance, when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men, but then he gave the ſpirit, therefore it meanes the gifts; not the perſon of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, he then gave gifts, but what gifts? not the gifts of ſanctification, but the gifts of tongues; which is ſpoken of, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and ſo notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, it is manifeſt, that he is God from eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This teaches how we ought, and how we may beleeve truly in the holy Ghoſt; namely, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him as God, the third perſon, proceeding from the Father, and the Sonne, ſanctifying the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: he that changes any thing of this deſcription,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102519:170"/>cannot beleeve in him aright, as he that beleeves in the holy Ghoſt as God; yet as begotten, but not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, beleeves not aright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay unto me, why may we not ſay, that the holy Ghoſt is begotten, as well as the Sonne, when as begetting is, receiving the whole Eſſence by communication? and what is proceeding, but receiving the whole Eſſence by communication? and why doe we ſay the Son is begotten, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt proceeds?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> did, that which is not written, thou oughteſt not thinke, or ſpeake; if thou finde it any where written, then thou maieſt, if not thou maieſt not: amongſt many things, Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> obſerves two in this miſery; why ſhould not we ſay, that the holy Ghoſt is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? he anſwers, becauſe the ſecond perſon is ſaid to be the Sonne, yea, the onely begotten Sonne; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dare not goe from that to aſcribe the begetting to any other; beſides it is ſaid, that the holy Ghoſt proceeds; he goes on to this purpoſe, if any aske:</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth begetting, and proceeding differ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer that they, doe differ I am ſure, but how? I know not: Againe, what is the difference to be begotten, and to proceed; I am inſufficient, to ſpeak, or expreſſe: <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> preſſes the point well; tell me, ſaith he, what is to be begotten, and I will tell thee what is proceeding? and yet if either ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to doe this, by ſearching into it, we may be both mad, and loſe our wits; therefore we ſay the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is of himſelf, not from another; the Son is of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:102519:170"/>Father alone, by way of begetting, the holy Ghoſt from them both, by way of proceeding: And if this ſeemes ſtrange, ſaith <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> take an Image of it: There is <hi>Adam, Seth, Evah; Adam</hi> not begotten, <hi>Seth</hi> begotten, <hi>Evah</hi> proceeding from <hi>Adam;</hi> there was one begotten, that was <hi>Seth,</hi> and there was one proceeding that was <hi>Evah,</hi> and one begetting, that was <hi>Adam;</hi> in a word, thus we are to believe of the perſonall Eſſence of the third perſon in trinity, the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. It followes in the deſcription, he ſanctifies the elect; therefore this admoniſhes every prophane man, that ſcoffes at purity, to ſee and repent of this prophaneſſe, becauſe purity is the worke of the holy Ghoſt; what doe you then deride when you mock at purity? tell me whom thou mockeſt at? even at the holy Ghoſt. I ſay, thou ſcoffer at purity, and holines, whatſoever thou art, thou ſcoffeſt at the ſpirit of God: <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. <hi>He that mocks the poore, derides him that made him;</hi> So I ſay to thee, that mockeſt the pure, that are made holy, &amp;c. thou mockeſt the holy Ghoſt that made him pure, and thou maieſt be ſaid in a ſort to commit a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: I ſay, not that unpardonable ſin, but a ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his perſonall worke of holineſſe; I am ſure, this one thing doth make manifeſt, that thou art not ſealed by the ſpirit of promiſe and redemption; even thy mocking at holineſſe, which is his worke; know then for certaine, the more baſe that holineſſe is in thy ſight, the more baſe thou art in the ſight of Gods ſpirit: better had it beene for thee, that thou hadſt
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102519:171"/>been made the moſt venomous creature on the face of the earth, then that thou ſhouldeſt not be made holy by this ſanctifying ſpirit of God; pray then, if it be poſſible, the thoughts of thy heart, and the words of thy mouth might be forgiven thee; for thou haſt not ſpoken againſt holy men only, but the holy ſpirit of God, as often as thou haft ſpoken againſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 5. Here is matter of comfort; Is holineſſe the worke of the ſpirit, (which is God?) is holineſſe begun? (as in truth here is but the beginning of it; here is but the earneſt, the firſt fruits?) is it ſo that thou wreſtleſt with thy corruptions, thou wouldeſt, and yet thou canſt not be perfect? comfort thy ſelfe, it is certaine that he will perfect it in his own time, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.6. Certainely he that hath begun this good worke will perfect it; although we have many weakeneſſes, as the Apoſtle cries out, Oh! wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? &amp;c. when he fights with infidelity, and with luſt, and cannot overcome it, yet here is the comfort, I ſay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, here is the comfort, he hath given thee that grace by which thou reſiſteſt, and by which thou ſhalt overcome evill; onely remember this, he will perfect it: as thou couldſt not teach him, how hee ſhould begin grace in thee; ſo thou muſt not teach him, how or when to perfect it in thee; howſoever in the meane time thou crieſt out, miſerable man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of ſinne, if thou hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, he will perfect it, but thou muſt continue wraſtling, till the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:102519:171"/>change of the body come, and who would not wraſtle for ſo holy a priſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 6. Laſtly, we note the blaſphemy of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians and Papiſts, when they tell us of falling away from grace, here is manifeſtly the contrary: It is the ſpirits worke to make the elect holy, will he be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his owne worke? away with ſuch blaſphemies from us, let us ſerve the providence of God for our perſeverance by attending upon the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here, and he will in part ſanctifie us here, and will not leave us untill he hath perfectly ſanctified us throughout, the whole ſoule and body and ſpirit, at the day of appearing of the Lord Jeſus. And thus much in ſpeciall of the third perſon in Trinity, the holy Ghoſt, as alſo in generall of the deſcription we gave of God in his owne nature.</p>
